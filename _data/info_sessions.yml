# How to use this file
#
# NOTE: This file is ONLY for GENERAL info sessions. Info sessions for a
#       specific job are located in that job's page.
#
# For each general info session, you will need to create an entry that looks
# like this:
#
# - link: https://www.eventbrite.com/...
#   date: 2023-02-02
#   time: 12:30-1:30pm ET (9:30-10:30am PT)
#
# But without the hash at the front. (The dash on the first line should be the
# very first thing on the first line. The other two lines should be indented
# two spaces. This is so the computer will understand how the lines relate to
# each other. You're basically programming!)
#
# The date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is used by the site builder to
# figure out what order to show the sessions in, and will be turned into a
# human-friendly block of text that includes the day of the week and month name.
#
# The time does not have to be in a particular format to work. However, the
# format that Team Talent has adopted is
#
#   start-end ET (start-end PT)
#
# Info sessions in the past will not be displayed. It is still a good idea to
# delete them from this file, though, to keep it tidy, but there's no rush.
