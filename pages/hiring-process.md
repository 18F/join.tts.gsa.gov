The federal hiring process can often be confusing. The information below is intended to provide an overview of the process and help with understanding how to apply to an opportunity within TTS.

## Process timeline

Hiring within the federal government takes more time than the typical private sector hiring process. Below is an example timeline based on our historic performance that should help you understand what to expect.

| Stage | Avg. Duration (days) |
|:--|:-:|
| [Application](#application) collection | 5 |
| TTS application review | 5 |
| GSA HR application review | 10 |
| [Interviews](#interviews) | 30 |
| [Offer & security](#security-and-onboarding) | 30 to 60 |
| **Total from application to start** | **80 to 110** |

## Application
When you apply for a role at TTS, you’ll need to submit a [government-style resume]({{site.baseurl}}/hiring-process/#government-style-resumes), which includes much more detail than a private-sector resume.

[Veterans’ Preference](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans-preference/) is applied for candidates who are veterans and have claimed their veteran status.

### How we collect and review applications
We collect applications during the period specified in the Basic Information section of each job posting. After the application window has closed (generally within 7-14 days), we review and evaluate all applications at the same time. The way we collect and review applications depends on the role and the type of hiring authority we're using.

**Competitive Service:** Applications are collected via usajobs.gov and reviewed by the General Services Administration (GSA) Human Resources team, our parent federal agency’s human resources office.

**Excepted Service:** Applications are collected via the postings within the TTS Join Page. All applications are reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts using a qualification process called [Category Rating](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/#url=Category-Rating). Once we’ve evaluated all applications for a particular job posting, we send all of the applications and evaluation scores to GSA Human Resources for review.

## Interviews
The interview process typically takes about 2-3 weeks from the initial phone screen to a formal interview. The process usually begins with a 30-minute preliminary screening by phone or video call. Plan to briefly talk about your skills, experience, and what you’re passionate about. We’ll share more about the role, our teams, and our work.

If we think you could be a good fit for the role you applied to, we’ll invite you to a series of formal video interviews with TTS team members. It’s during these longer conversations that we’ll discuss your past work experience in addition to the skills and knowledge that you can bring with you to TTS. If TTS identifies you as a strong candidate, a TTS recruiter will reach out to you with next steps.

See the [18F Engineering Hiring Guide](https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/) for more details on the process for those positions.

## Security and onboarding
The hiring process continues in partnership with the GSA Human Resources team. They’re responsible for extending tentative and official final offers. Here's the process:

- A GSA HR specialist will call you with a tentative offer. “Tentative” means the offer is contingent on a security clearance. This offer will include salary for your consideration.
  - **Please note: This is only a tentative offer, do not give notice, resign, etc from your current employer until you receive the final offer with a confirmed start dated from HR.**
- Once you've accepted the tentative offer, you will receive a USAccess email to schedule a time to provide your fingerprints at [one of these locations](http://www.fedidcard.gov/centerlocator.aspx) for your security clearance.
- You will schedule and complete your fingerprint scans.
- You will complete the [e-QIP questionnaire](https://www.opm.gov/investigations/e-qip-application/) for which you will need to provide your past seven years of employment and location history as well as information for individuals who can provide verifications of your employment and location history. We **strongly encourage** you to keep a digital or printed copy of the completed e-QIP for use during your interview with the background investigator.
- Once your e-QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer.
- GSA HR and the TTS Talent team will work with you to identify and set a start date. New employees start every other Monday on the first day of a GSA pay period.

### Security clearance documents
All government positions require some kind of background check. Most roles at TTS require a public trust position clearance, which is more thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources team will guide you through it.

It can be helpful to start pulling some documents together in advance. The forms you can expect to complete include:

- [OF306 — Declaration for Federal Employment (PDF)](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/declaration-federal-employment)
- [GSA 3665 — Authorization to Obtain Credit Report](https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/authorization-obtain-credit-report)
- If you want to prepare for the e-QIP by gathering information in advance, the [SF-85p (PDF)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) includes the same questions, so you can use it to get a head start.
