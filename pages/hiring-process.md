Don’t let the federal hiring process seem daunting. We demystify it
below, so you know what to expect. Here's a look at the average time of each stage from application to your first day at TTS.

  |Process Stage | Average Duration/Days |
|:--|:-:|
| [Application](#application) collection | 5 |
| TTS application review | 5 |
| GSA HR application review | 10 |
| [Interviews](#interviews) | 30 |
| [Offer and security](#security-and-onboarding) | 30 to 60 |
| **Total from application to start** | **80 to 110** |

### Application

When you apply for a role at TTS, you’ll need to submit a
[government-style
resume](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/). We collect applications during the period specified in the [Basic
Information section](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/federal-job-posting/#basic-information/) of the job posting, generally five-10 days.
After the period has closed, we review and evaluate all applications at
the same time.

[Veterans’
Preference](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans-preference/)
is applied for candidates who have claimed their veteran status.

### Interviews

It typically takes two-three weeks from the initial phone screen to the
formal interview. The process usually begins with a 30-minute
preliminary screening by phone or video. During this call, plan to talk
briefly about your skills, experience, and professional passion. We’ll
share more about the role, the teams, and the work we do on a daily
basis.

If we think, based on the initial call, you could be a good fit for the
role, we’ll invite you to a series of formal video interviews with
different TTS team members. It’s during these longer conversations that
we’ll discuss your past work experience in addition to the skills and
knowledge that you bring with you to TTS.

If TTS identifies you as a strong candidate after we complete the interviews, a TTS recruiter will reach out to you with next steps.

### Security and Onboarding

The hiring process continues in partnership with GSA’s (our parent
agency) Human Resources team. They’re responsible for extending
tentative and official final offers. The process is as follows:

-   A GSA HR specialist will call you with a tentative offer. “Tentative” means the offer is contingent on a security clearance. This offer will include salary for your consideration.
    -   **Please note:** This is only a tentative offer. At this point you should not give notice or resign from your current employer. You should delay these steps until you receive the final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.
-   Once you have accepted the tentative offer, you will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You will need to login and accept your tentative offer.
-   Once you accept your tentative offer, you will complete a series of forms and receive a USAccess email requesting you to schedule a time to provide your fingerprints for your security clearance and complete a e-QIP security questionnaire.
-   Once your e-QIP has been initially cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer.
-   At this stage, GSA HR and the TTS Talent team will work with you to identify and set a start date.

#### Security Clearance Documents

All government positions require some level of background check. Most
roles at TTS require a public trust position clearance, which is more
thorough than most private-sector background checks but not as intensive
as a higher government security clearance. The clearance process adds
some time and forms to the hiring process, but the GSA Human Resources
team will guide you through it.

## More about how we hire
### TTS is an Equal Opportunity Employer

We’re building a team that reflects our country. We don’t
discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity or
expression, national origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation,
marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an
employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service,
or other non-merit factors.

### Hiring Authorities

There are two primary types of [hiring
authorities](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/service/)
used by TTS: Competitive Service and Excepted Service. The application
and hiring process will vary slightly based on the type of role for which you are
 applying.

**Competitive Service:** Applicants for all competitive service roles must complete the application process at usajobs.gov. Individuals go
through a competitive hiring process before being selected and
appointed.  This hiring process may consist of a
written test, an evaluation of the individual’s education and
experience, or an evaluation of other attributes necessary for
successful performance in the position to be filled.

**Excepted Service:** These roles are “not to exceed” (NTE) positions,
which means they are two-year terms and can be extended once for a total
of four years of service. These roles are not always posted on
usajobs.gov. Instead, candidates can apply via our online application.

### Eligibility

For **Competitive Service** roles: All United States citizens and
nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) are eligible
to apply.

For **Excepted Service** roles: All United States citizens and nationals
(residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) are eligible to apply.
