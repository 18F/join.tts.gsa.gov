{{ sidenav }} TTS is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and to build a workforce that reflects the diversity of the citizens that we serve. We invite all eligible United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Islands) to apply to work at TTS. 

The federal hiring process differs from industry and private-sector hiring. Federal hiring often takes longer than industry and requires specific actions. When applying for jobs at TTS, the expected duration of each step of the hiring process is as follows:

- Application collection - 5 business days or until an application cap is met
- Resume qualification - 2 to 3 weeks
- Interviews - 1 month
- Offer and security - 2 to 3 months
- Total from application to start - 3 - 5 months

## Information Sessions

TTS hosts monthly general hiring information sessions and role-specific sessions for upcoming or newly-opened roles. At our general sessions, candidates learn about working at TTS, what kinds of roles we hire for, and more about the application process. Our role-specific info sessions briefly cover some of the same information and offer a chance to hear directly from the hiring team about the vision for the role and what a day-in-the-life might actually look like. Candidates have an opportunity  to ask us questions about the application process, the work, and the team culture. 
TTS does not conduct one-on-one conversations with candidates about roles to ensure an equitable hiring process. Please attend one of our public information sessions for these details.

A list of upcoming information sessions can be found on the [JoinTTS
homepage]({% link pages/index.md %}).

## Application

Applications are collected during the period specified in the [Basic Information section](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/federal-job-posting/#basic-information/) of the job posting, generally about a week or until an application cap is reached. After the period has closed, all applications are reviewed and evaluated  at the same time.

TTS does not use automated screening tools. Your application will be evaluated by a HR Specialist or a panel of subject matter experts. 

When you apply for a role at TTS, you are required to submit a [government-style resume](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/). Be explicit in your resume and include all relevant work experiences and details. Do not assume the reader has expert knowledge or context of your job history. Because applications are reviewed by real people, the application review process typically takes several weeks, depending on the number of applications received.

## Interviews

The interview process typically takes about a month, with approximately 3-4 interview rounds. The first round is a 30-60 minute preliminary screen by phone or video. During this call, plan to talk briefly about your skills, experience, and professional passion. We’ll share more information about the role, the team, and the opportunity.

If you advance past the preliminary screen, we’ll invite you to a series of formal video interviews with various TTS team members. During these longer conversations, we will discuss your past work experience and how your skills and knowledge apply to TTS. Some positions may require a technical interview such as a coding exercise or leadership and collaboration interview before moving forward to the final round of interviews. 

The final round of interviews always include a TTS Core Values interview which is intended to evaluate candidate alignment with [the organization’s values](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/tts-history/#our-values).

We share copies of the interview guide, which includes the questions and interviewer names,  with candidates in advance of your interviews. Sharing questions in advance provides you a more informed interview experience so you can better understand what we’re looking for. 


### Interview Format

We typically use Google Meet for our interviews. If you are not comfortable or familiar with using Google Meet, let your recruiter know and they will be happy to set up a test chat with you prior to your interviews! You can also test your sound and video prior to your interview using [these instructions](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10409699?hl=en).

In case there are technical issues with your video call, you will also be provided with a dial-in number so you can call-in by phone.
We are happy to work with your individual needs to ensure you have a good interviewing experience and can use your preferred method of communication.


### Accommodations

We want to interview you at your best. Let us know if you require  any accommodations. Some examples:

- Allowing you extra time to answer questions
- Sharing questions in written form as well as verbally
- Bringing an emotional support or service animal to your interview
- Using a medium other than video chat
- Having a captioner or an ASL interpreter

## Security and Onboarding

If you are identified as a strong candidate after the interviews, the hiring process continues in partnership with GSA’s (our parent agency) Human Resources team. They’re responsible for extending tentative and official final offers. The process is as follows:
1. A GSA HR specialist will contact you with a tentative offer. “Tentative” means the offer is contingent on a security clearance. This offer will include salary for your consideration. At this point, you should not give notice or resign from your current employer. You should delay these steps until you receive the final offer with a confirmed start date from HR.
2. You will receive an email from the HR onboarding system. You must login to the system and accept your tentative offer.
3. You must complete some required forms and will receive an email from USAccess with instructions on how to schedule a fingerprinting appointment for your security clearance.
4. Once your paperwork has cleared, you will receive an interim security clearance, and a GSA HR specialist will call you with a final offer.
5. At this stage, GSA HR and the TTS Talent team will work with you to identify and set a start date.

### Security Clearance Documents

All government positions require background checks. Most roles at TTS require a public trust position clearance, which may be more thorough than most private-sector background checks. The GSA HR will guide you through the process.
