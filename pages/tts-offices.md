alongside top agency changemakers._

The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program is made up of mid- to
senior-level individuals with a proven track record of success in

## Office of Acquisition

approaches. We embody the same values as the rest of TTS: transparency, open
source, human-centered, and agile methodologies — and we buy products and
services built with these principles. In the spirit of innovation, we also
experiment with new, collaborative ways of doing procurement while adhering to
the various regulations and policies governing our work.
