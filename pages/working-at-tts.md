## TTS Mission and Values

TTS’s mission is to design and deliver a digital government with and for the
American public. The organization’s values are:

- **Inclusion:** We put people first and celebrate what brings us together and
  makes each of us unique to meet the public’s needs.
- **Integrity:** We are present, transparent, and honest to enable accessible
  and trustworthy innovation.
- **Impact:** We grow together and create lasting change for the good of the
  public and public servants. TTS’s values and
  [code of conduct](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/code-of-conduct/) were
  created by employees from across the organization. TTS is a remote-first
  organization, and we have employees distributed throughout the country. Want

## Employee Resource Groups and Guilds

At TTS, affinity groups are voluntary, employee-driven groups that are organized
around shared interests, identities, experiences, or dimensions. They offer
forums for employees to gather socially and share ideas outside of their
particular business units. It’s a space for community and support, especially in
situations in which aspects of one’s identity are in the minority or are
marginalized. This includes affinity groups for and by:

- African American and Black employees
- Latinx employees (a space for people who identify as Latinx, Hispanic,
  Chicanx, Boricua, Cubano, etc.)
- Asian, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian employees
- LGBTQQIAAP employees (anyone who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
  transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, or pansexual)
- Jewish employees
- People with disabilities
- Women
- Veterans
- Parents
