## Opportunity overview

These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS). TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.

We will be interviewing and hiring for this role on an ongoing basis and to help navigate the process, we’ve created a [guide](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/rolling-hiring/) to help explain what to expect after submitting your resume.

## Role summary

Designers at TTS work across design contexts. They drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts clearly, and work with cross functional teams to build and test them. They model best practices in user-centered design within TTS and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

Our Designers have deep experience in user research (generative, foundational and evaluative). In addition to research, we look for strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, product design, service design, content design and/or information architecture.

As a Designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams made up of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition to building useful and usable digital services, you will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started.

If you are committed to improving government services for all who need them this is the position for you.

Types of designers we are currently hiring for:
- UX Design
- Service Design
- Content Strategy
- Product Design

Some of the teams we are currently hiring for (not a complete list):
Please note, while a candidate's preference on teams may be taken into consideration, a final hiring decision on which team a candidate will join depends on the candidate's skillsets as well as current needs of each team. 
- [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/): Cross-discipline teams that work on projects supporting agencies across the federal government.
- [USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/): A team supporting a large web presence, including the government’s “front door” that routes the public to government agency resources.

## Key objectives
### 1. Demonstrate excellence in design, while grasping the core questions and responsibilities of at least one design discipline.

In addition to strong skill in experience design, we expect expertise in at least one of the following disciplines:

- Interaction design: Define interface logic and behavior, always keeping human behaviors and needs in mind
- Information architecture: Organize and structure complex information to help diverse audiences easily find what they need
- Service design: Improve the relationship of the customer or user and the service provider across all of their interactions and communication channels
- Product design: Develop clear and accessible visual systems, while advancing human-centered design practices
- Content strategy & design: Deliver high-quality, user-centered content and lead projects from a content perspective

**GS13 objectives for successful TTS Designers:**
- Support collaborative decision-making by telling compelling stories drawn from research to build shared understanding
- Show persistent commitment to thoughtful, inclusive, ethical user research
- Deliver whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, sitemaps, flowcharts, storyboards, user stories, or other innovative approaches

- Use modern interaction design patterns and best practices, understanding that there are exceptions to every rule
- Commit to making what we build fully accessible to the people we serve

- Collaborate with colleagues and partners who are taking on new tasks and roles within design and research
- Share knowledge, techniques, tools, patterns, and expert advice with colleagues, partners, and the public
- Promote empathy not just for members of the public, but also for our partners across the government and our co-workers
- Contribute to team-wide resources and training materials, including methods, tutorials, guides, presentations, and design toolkits
- Show a commitment to growing their skills through professional development

### 3. Work effectively in the federal government
