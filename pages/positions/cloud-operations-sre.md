## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

cloud.gov is looking for talented site reliability engineers to help us deliver better digital services to the public. As an engineer, you will be a builder, contributor, and a catalyst. With the support of the team, you will solve large complex problems while spreading user-centered, open, and transparent culture. [Cloud.gov is an open source team](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), so most of what you work on will be open source.

Site reliability engineers on our team are:

- Comfortable working with cloud computing platforms and/or infrastructure
- Interested in building systems and processes that meet federal requirements in effective and modern ways, to help other teams in government meet requirements with less work
- Excited to tackle challenging problems in order to improve the lives of others

**This role is perfect for you if you care deeply about building great public-facing digital products and services.** You should be excited to apply your skills, share them with your colleagues, and learn from them in turn.

cloud.gov’s core programming languages are Go, Ruby, Python, Java, JavaScript, and POSIX shell in addition to YAML for configuration. You should have experience with at least two of those languages, and should be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. The best candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Maintainable Software Development:** Knowledge and ability to develop software in a repeatable and documentable way, with emphasis on automation, testing, measuring, and scaling infrastructure.
- **Modern Technology and Practices:** The ability to understand and apply modern technology and software development principles and practices.
- **Agile Orientation:** Ability to apply agile and open source philosophies to deliver work in a frequent and iterative fashion to address user needs.  
- **Communication:** Communicate effectively with a variety of audiences, particularly in consulting scenarios, to establish a shared vision and understanding of a project’s technical implementation, objectives and goals.
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment.


If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} grade level in the Federal service. Specialized experience is:
