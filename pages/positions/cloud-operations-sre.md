## Role Summary:
### {{ page.title }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}
cloud.gov, a product team within 18F, is looking for talented site reliability engineers to help us deliver better digital services to the public. As an engineer at 18F, you will be a builder, contributor, and a catalyst. With the support of the team, you will solve large complex problems while spreading user-centered, open, and transparent culture. [18F is an open source team](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), so most of what you work on will be open source.

Site reliability engineers on our team are:

- Comfortable working with cloud computing platforms and/or infrastructure.
- Interested in building systems and processes that meet federal requirements in effective and modern ways, to help other teams in government meet requirements with less work.
- Excited to tackle challenging problems in order to improve the lives of others.

**This role is perfect for you if you care deeply about building great public-facing digital products and services.** You should be excited to apply your skills, share them with your colleagues, and learn from them in turn.

cloud.gov’s core programming languages are Go, Ruby, Python, Java, JavaScript, and POSIX shell in addition to YAML for configuration. You should have experience with at least two of those languages, and should be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. The best candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.


## Key Objectives

### Key objective #1: Operate Cloud Foundry, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and security
- Create processes and procedures that keep Cloud Foundry environments resilient, fault-tolerant, and consistent.

- Work with the team in developing and maintaining robust problem handling, including responding to system alerts, troubleshooting system errors, and resolving incidents.
- Ensure infrastructure is used efficiently.

### Key objective #2: Automate platform operations using modern software development techniques
- Deliver code that’s easy to deploy, update, and monitor by ensuring that the necessary tooling is present early in the project development cycle or by introducing tooling into an existing project, as needed.
- Treat configuration as code: manage, design, deploy, and test platform operations.
- Take an iterative approach to identifying and removing single points of failure.
- Deploy software in a repeatable and documented way, reducing errors, tracking specifications, process, systems, and procedures.
- Write and participate in code review, which can include Go, Ruby, Python, Java, JavaScript, POSIX shell, and YAML.

### Key objective #3: Practice an exceptional level of customer service, providing a unique, tailored experience.
- Be a credible technician in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes. 
- Participate in business development calls and work to identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner. 
- Act as primary point of contact, responding to questions as part of customer support rotation.
- Explain the platform to people who have varying levels of technical knowledge, always meeting the customer where they are. 
- Integrate customer needs into the technical process, producing documentation and providing compliance support for auditors and FedRAMP technical reviewers.


### Key objective #4: Contribute to the culture and knowledge of the engineering team, practicing and enthusiastically sharing agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.
- Work within a distributed, multidisciplinary agile team by participating in constructive discussions, openly sharing knowledge, and demonstrating value for technical and non-technical contributions. 
- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences. 
- Provide visibility into each project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it. 
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of the elements of agile methodology (scrum, kanban, and so on). 
- Practice human-centered design, user testing, feature prioritization, DevOps, and other relevant concepts. 

### Key objective #5: In conjunction with team leadership, help establish and implement an organizational vision.
- Develop new insights into situations and question conventional approaches. 
- Develop, implement, and drive technical strategy in engineering-specific and organization-wide contexts.
- Keep up-to-date on policies and trends that affect the organization and shape stakeholders’ views. 
- Adapt to change and quickly integrate new information. 
- Formulate and execute consistently against objectives and priorities.
- Take a long-term view and build a shared vision with people across the Technology Transformation Service (TTS), GSA, and the U.S. government.


## Minimum Qualifications

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Minimum Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

- Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
- The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience
 
The Minimum Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/hiring-process/)
