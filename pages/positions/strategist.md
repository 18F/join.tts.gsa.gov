## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

Federal government agencies often approach 18F for help with improving an internal process or redesigning the way they present information to the American public. As a strategist with 18F, you’ll lead early efforts with these agency partners to define what problem they’re trying to solve and identify what’s needed to ensure successful next steps. Your work will include aligning stakeholders, talking to end users, turning vague ideas into concrete priorities, and minimizing risk in the product development process. And you’ll do all this in a spirit of partnership, with a sense of humility and empathy for our partners and the people who use their systems.

We're looking for senior-level candidates who have consulting experience along with a background in a user-centered design or strategy discipline such as digital strategy, service design, user experience design, content design/strategy, user research, product or software development. Experience in an agile development environment a plus.

## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Lead small, cross-functional project teams that define the partner’s problem
- Navigate complex organizational relationships to bring stakeholders together around common goals and priorities
- Identify user and organizational needs through formal interviews, informal conversations, contextual inquiry,
workshops, and analytics research
- Work comfortably amidst uncertainty
- Provide strategic value to partners early, reduce the risks of improperly-scoped work, and allow the team to quickly
steer the project in the right direction
- Create artifacts to communicate what you learn in a way that resonates with our agency partners

### Objective 2: Deliver recommendations that frame next steps
- Give agency partners and peers the advice they need to hear over what they want to hear, in a manner that respects their
intelligence and experience
- Provide visibility into the project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it
- Explain issues clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Help agency partners tell their own story within their organization
- Take a position on what needs to happen in order for a project to be set up for success, and communicate this position
in a way that’s easy for stakeholders to understand

### Objective #3: Model the behaviors we want to see partners adopt
- Teach agency teams how to take risks and validate ideas
- Demonstrate how to incorporate users into the product development process
- Help teams discover their internal creative thinkers and champions
- Hold yourself and your team accountable for measurable, high-quality, timely, and cost-effective results
- Demonstrate credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes

### Objective #4: Contribute to your team’s continued success
- Continually make a strong case for iterative, user-centered design on every project
- Contribute to team-wide reusable resources and materials
- Recognize when practices no longer serve the team and recommend a way forward
- Share your work in an unfinished state and give peer feedback in critique sessions
- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual
differences

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Problem Solving:** Research, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information to define problems and propose solutions effectively
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with others to accomplish shared goals and build strong working relationships
- **Communication:** Convey information and ideas clearly, succinctly and effectively with a variety of audiences to establish a shared vision and understanding
- **Leadership:** Lead cross-functional teams to meet organization and project objectives
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Work with integrity, transparency and resiliency in a civic-minded or high-impact environment

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. Specialized experience is:

include **ALL** of the following:
- Leading client-facing consulting projects or initiatives

- Leading teams in the development of digital products or services using agile development methodologies
- Leading the development of content strategies for web or digital products.

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)
