## Role Summary:

### {{ page.title }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

Federal government agencies often approach 18F for help with improving an internal process or redesigning the way they present information to the American public. As a strategist with 18F, you’ll lead early efforts with these agency partners to define what problem they’re trying to solve and identify what’s needed to ensure successful next steps. Your work will include articulating what the current state is, aligning stakeholders, talking to end users, turning vague ideas into concrete priorities, and minimizing risk in the product development process. And you’ll do all this in a spirit of partnership, with a sense of humility and empathy for our partners and the people who use their systems. 

We're looking for a senior-level candidate in the Washington, D.C. area who has consulting experience along with a background in a user-centered design or digital strategy discipline. Experience in an agile development environment a plus.


## Key Objectives

- Navigate complex organizational relationships to bring stakeholders together around common goals and priorities.
- Identify user and organizational needs through formal interviews, informal conversations, contextual inquiry,
workshops, and analytics research.
- Work comfortably amidst uncertainty.
- Provide strategic value to partners early, reduce the risks of improperly-scoped work, and allow the team to quickly
steer the project in the right direction.
- Create artifacts to communicate what you learn in a way that resonates with our agency partners.

### Objective 2: Deliver recommendations that frame next steps
- Give agency partners and peers the advice they need to hear over what they want to hear, in a manner that respects their
intelligence and experience.
- Provide visibility into the project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it.
- Explain issues clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Help agency partners tell their own story within their organization.
- Take a position on what needs to happen in order for a project to be set up for success, and communicate this position
in a way that’s easy for stakeholders to understand.

### Objective #3: Model the behaviors we want to see partners adopt
- Teach agency teams how to take risks and validate ideas.
- Demonstrate how to incorporate users into the product development process.
- Help teams discover their internal creative thinkers and champions.
- Hold yourself and your team accountable for measurable, high-quality, timely, and cost-effective results.
- Demonstrate credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes.

### Objective #4: Contribute to your team’s continued success
- Continually promote 18F’s ways of working by making a strong case for iterative, user-centered design on every project.
- Participate in business development by understanding what our agency partners need and articulating how 18F might be able to help them achieve it.
- Contribute to team-wide reusable resources and materials.
- Recognize when practices no longer serve the team and recommend a way forward.
- Share your work in an unfinished state and give peer feedback in critique sessions.
- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual
differences.

## Minimum Qualifications

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Minimum Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

- The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.

    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience
 
The Minimum Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of.
