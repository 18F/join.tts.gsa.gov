## Role Summary:

-Review code and consult with other engineers on new features and their implications for site performance, reliability, and security for the security of CoE and agency DevOps environments
-Conduct load tests to ensure the application is ready to handle projected user traffic
-Improve automation and fault tolerance of the deployment process
-Drive long-term improvement in CoE and agency DevOps system availability by removing single points of failure

### Key objective #3: Practice an exceptional level of customer service with all partners, providing a unique, tailored experience.  

-Explain product or services to people who have varying levels of technical knowledge — always meet the agency partner where they’re at
-Empathetically guide our agency partners through the bureaucracy of the sometimes long and arduous compliance and security processes 
-Skillfully map specific inquiries to product capabilities, identifying the product that best meets the agency partner’s needs
-Serve as a liaison between the stakeholders and the project teams, delivering feedback to the team, enabling them to make necessary changes to product performance or presentation

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Maintainable Software Development:** Knowledge and ability to develop software, with emphasis on reliability, automation, testing, measuring, and scaling infrastructure
- **Modern Infrastructure Practices and Architecture:** Ability to operate complex software at scale in a cloud environment using principles of Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps
- **Production Operations:** Ability to operate production systems at scale with high availability
- **Communication:** Ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences and stakeholders to establish a shared vision and understanding of a project’s technical implementation, objectives, and goals
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}
