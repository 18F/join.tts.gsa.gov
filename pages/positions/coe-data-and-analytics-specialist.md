We are looking for a Data & Analytics Specialist to join the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (COE) to help develop and improve the capabilities and services of our partner agencies.

The federal government has hundreds of thousands of data sets and managing that data is an extremely challenging task. As a Data & Analytics Specialist, you will help agencies liberate and embrace their data, equip them with profound insights drawn from that data, empowering them to more effectively fulfill their mission. 

Data & Analytics Specialists should not be theoreticians, but rather practitioners and leaders in the craft of data science. You’ll need to be able to get hands on when necessary, but we lead government contractor teams to help partner agencies capitalize on their existing tools and resources. It’s imperative that our Data and Analytics Specialist is dedicated to results and has genuine passion about building a sustainable data infrastructure within government. We aspire to not only help our partners solve their problems efficiently and with the ability to scale, but also help them do it in an agile way.

- Develop methods to monitor, evaluate, analyze, and report progress toward achieving performance goals and to inform continual improvements to service design and delivery
- Evaluate existing feedback and performance tools against best practices and agency requirements and make recommendations for new data-management tools and infrastructure
- Coordinate the implementation, deployment, troubleshooting and training for data analysis and reporting tools across the agency
- Conduct workshops with agency teams to identify uses of and promote understanding of their data sets


### Key objective #2: You will promote the adoption of modern technology practices and strategies through teaching, coaching, and knowledge sharing.

- Practice and enthusiastically share agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle
- Deliver educational workshops to accelerate learning and adoption of agile principles and practices
- Capture specific technology capabilities (e.g. strategies, roadmaps, playbooks) to  document best practices across government
- Promote best practices for data governance (e.g. strategies, roadmaps, charters) and provide guidance for instituting enterprise-wide data governance as it aligns with organizational goals
- Inspire honesty and integrity through open communication and liberal knowledge sharing across a multi-disciplinary teams
- Create compelling case studies on how users are benefiting from the program, providing a special focus on lessons learned


### Key objective #3: Practice an exceptional level of customer service with all partners, providing a unique, tailored experience.  

- Explain product or services to people who have varying levels of technical knowledge — always meet the agency partner where they are
- Empathetically guide our agency partners through the bureaucracy of the sometimes long and arduous compliance and security processes 
- Skillfully map specific inquiries to product capabilities, identifying the product that best meets the agency partner’s needs
- Serve as a liaison between the stakeholders and the project teams, delivering feedback to the team, enabling them to make necessary changes to product performance or presentation
- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Analytics Technical Fluency:** The ability to assimilate, synthesize and leverage highly technical data to drive decision making and effectively communicate that information to audiences with a wide range of technical expertise
- **Leadership:** Ability to effectively inspire and lead cross-functional teams to meet the project vision and shared objectives of agency partner organizations, while simultaneously providing support and guidance to all members of the partner agency
- **Agile Orientation:** Ability to apply agile methodologies to deliver work in a frequent and iterative fashion to address user needs
- **Communication:** Communicate effectively with a variety of audiences, particularly in consulting scenarios, to establish
a shared vision and understanding of a project’s technical implementation, objectives and goals
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact
environment


If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.
