## Role summary

Designers at TTS work across design contexts. They drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts clearly, and work with cross functional teams to build and test them. They model best practices in user-centered design within TTS and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

Our Designers have deep experience in user research (generative, foundational and evaluative). In addition to research, we look for strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, product design, service design, content design and/or information architecture. 

As a Designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams made up of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition to building useful and usable digital services, you will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started. 

If you are committed to improving government services for all who need them this is the position for you. 

Please note TTS evaluates grade levels based on the following criteria: 
- GS13s participate
- GS14s lead AND participate
- GS15s mentor/teach others how to lead, and also lead AND participate
