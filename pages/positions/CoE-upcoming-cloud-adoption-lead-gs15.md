## Role Summary: 

### Cloud Adoption Lead (GS15)

Your challenge as the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (COE) Cloud Adoption Lead is to help those agencies that have 
come to depend on legacy data centers migrate to cloud and hybrid environments. You will work to understand the needs and 
the desires of the client, analyze systems to meet those needs and work cross functionally with both members from the partner
agency and vendor partners to implement solutions.  By using an agile and flexible framework, the CoE accelerates cloud 
adoption across the enterprise.

The key experience requirement for this position is leading organizational strategy and change related to migration to cloud
environments. You should have strong knowledge of public clouds (Amazon Web Services (AWS) and/or Microsoft Azure), Redhat,
VMWare and federal compliance requirements in server configuration, tool development, and access controls.

No one can be equally expert at each phase of the cloud adoption process, but we expect a working knowledge of legacy 
infrastructure configurations, data migrations strategies (including SnapMirror, Storage Area Network replication, Powershell,
and Service Management Automation), security best practices, post-migration testing, debugging and systems analysis skills,
and virtualization and containerization.
