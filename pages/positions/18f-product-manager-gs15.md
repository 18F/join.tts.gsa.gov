**Please note: Innovation Specialist is the official government title for this Product Manager position.**

## Role Summary: 

### 18F Product Manager GS-15
As a Product Manager at 18F, you’ll lead cross-functional teams to deliver user-centered products using agile methodologies and modern software development practices while building capacity for product innovation in government. When you build products with a partner agency, you’ll coach them on modern product development practices so they’re set up for success in the long term.

Product managers on our team are:

- Strategic thinkers who are comfortable defining a compelling vision and designing a measurable strategy to achieve that vision.
- Decisive leaders who know how to motivate cross-functional teams to build the right thing.
- Comfortable working in a consulting capacity as well as running a product directly.
- Empathetic coaches, mentors, and advocates who help partner agency staff develop the skills to manage their own products.


## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Own or steward the product vision and lead end-to-end product development
You are an experienced product manager who can unite vision and execution to lead an interdisciplinary team in delivering the right value to the right people. You’re skilled at defining a meaningful end goal to galvanize your team, whether that means generating a product vision and strategy with your team or helping agency partners articulate and focus their vision and strategy.

Successful product managers at 18F:

- Establish a vision and ensure all members of the 18F and partner teams have a shared understanding of product objectives, goals, and metrics.
- Analyze market demand and market fit, do competitive analysis, and guide build vs. buy or reuse approaches.
- Create a product strategy and roadmap and develop a communications strategy supporting product goals.
- Identify and proactively monitor and address product risks.
- Lead a cross-functional team of researchers, designers, and engineers to ensure the right product is delivered to the right audience. 
- Work with the team to set and meet quality standards for any product you build.
- Use evidence (user research, analytics, and other metrics) to make product decisions, ask “why” a lot, and recognize the difference between “we can’t do that because of bureaucracy” and “we can’t do that because of the law.”
- Energize and motivate the team by recognizing successes and learning from failures.
- Ensure your product complies with federal regulations such as Authority to Operate, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and Section 508.


### Objective #2: Work with agency partners to make sure they’re set up for success
As a product manager at 18F, your job goes beyond delivering software; you are responsible for creating sustainable outcomes that benefit the public. You’ll help your partners adopt a modern product development mindset and make sure they have the right team to sustain their product once 18F’s engagement with them is done. You’ll also coach and mentor agency staff, helping them develop into capable product managers in their own right.

Successful product managers at 18F:

- Work with partners to establish in-house product ownership.
- Help partners understand how to deliver value, rather than features, to their users.
- Help partners navigate complex bureaucratic relationships to bring stakeholders together around a common product vision and strategy.
- Coach the partner in agile, open source, and user-centered principles so they understand the value these practices bring.
- Ensure the partner understands how to do day-to-day product management by coaching and mentoring junior product managers. 
- Work with partners to ensure they have the right team to continue iterating on the product beyond the engagement.
- Work with partners to establish relationships with their security, operations, and IT teams that will help sustain the product in the long term.
- Work with partners to develop communications strategies to sustain the product during and beyond the engagement.


### Objective #3: Build institutional expertise around product management

As a member of 18F, you’ll also be part of the Technology Transformation Service. You’ll share best practices and tools with your peers across the organization. You’ll collaborate and share insights and opinions with other product managers, contributing to our growing culture of product management. You’ll share lessons learned from your work at 18F with peers and leaders to help guide our approach to digital transformation.

Successful product managers at 18F:

- Keep abreast of product management best practices and bring them back into the organization.
- Stay on top of new technologies and how they could help solve government problems.
- Speak at conferences to talk about 18F’s work and share our mission.
- Contribute to 18F’s culture of transparency by publishing accounts of your successes and failures.
- Continually seek out new product management tools that could improve the way we work.
- Pay attention to well-supported open source product offerings that can be reused in a government context to solve common problems (so that we help agencies not build custom tools if not needed).
