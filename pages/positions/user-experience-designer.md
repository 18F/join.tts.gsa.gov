## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

User experience designers at 18F drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts visually, and work with developers and product managers to build and test them. They foster best practices in user-centered design within 18F and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

UX designers should have deep strength in design research (both generative and evaluative). No one can be equally expert at everything, but in addition to design research, we do expect strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, service design, and information architecture.

As a UX designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. Besides building useful and usable digital services, part of your job will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started.

If you are committed to improving government services by focusing on the people who need them most, this is the position for you.

## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Demonstrate excellence in design research, while grasping the core questions and responsibilities of at least one other UX discipline.

In addition to strong skill in design research, we expect expertise in at least one of the following disciplines:
- **Interaction design:** Define interface logic and behavior, always keeping human behaviors and needs in mind.
- **Information architecture:** Organize and structure complex information to help diverse audiences easily find what they need.
- **Service design:** Improve the relationship of the customer or user and the service provider across all of their interactions and communication channels.

- Zoom in and out. Generate innovative, high-level product strategies as well as the practical project steps and considerations to get there. Are visionary in objective, but pragmatic in approach.
- Support collaborative decision making by telling compelling stories drawn from research that illustrate the pros and cons of various options.
- Show persistent commitment to thoughtful and ethical user research.
- Deliver whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, sitemaps, flowcharts, storyboards, user stories, or interpretive dance.
- Create written materials and visual presentations that are accessible to non-experts but that are legally and technically accurate.
- Incorporate UX into agile development sprints, coordinating with visual and content designers, developers, and product managers to achieve a strategic vision.
- Use modern interaction design patterns and best practices, understanding that there are exceptions to every rule.
- Commit to making what we build fully accessible to the people we serve.

### Objective 2: Advance UX practice

- Clearly communicate user-centered methods and their value to non-designers.
- Mentor and coach colleagues and partners who are taking on new tasks and roles within design and research.
- Share knowledge, techniques, tools, patterns, and expert advice with colleagues, partners, and the public.
- Promote empathy not just for members of the public, but also our partners across the government and our co-workers.

### Objective #3: Work effectively in the federal government

- Skillfully navigate complex organizational relationships to resolve questions.
- Cooperatively negotiate disagreements and mediate compromises.
- Build inclusive, respectful partnerships with diverse groups of people.
- Demonstrate genuine interest in the day-to-day activities that keep our government running.

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Research methods:** The knowledge and ability to understand and apply user research tools and methodologies.
- **Design methods:** The ability to design interactive digital products, systems, and services.
- **Agile or iterative development:** The knowledge of design and development approaches that include repeated testing of ideas and revision of those ideas based on testing results, and the ability to carry them out in a professional environment.
- **Teamwork & Collaboration:** The ability to work cooperatively with others to accomplish objectives and build inclusive and mutually-beneficial partnerships.
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** The ability to work with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment.

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. Specialized experience is:

- Developing user research plans, interview protocols or question guides
- Conducting User interviews
- Conducting Contextual inquiry or Observational research

- Using agile, lean or other iterative product development approaches
- Teaching or mentoring non-designers how to use user-centered design methodologies
- Managing or leading design efforts within complex organizations or highly regulated environments

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

For each job on your resume, provide:

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)
