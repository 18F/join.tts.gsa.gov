## Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. Specialized experience is:

**Specialized experience must have been obtained in an information technology environment and is defined as experience:**

- **Creating sourcing strategies for a technology organization’s talent acquisition program;**
- **Training and mentoring recruiters on strategic sourcing methods;**
- **Sourcing candidates for technology positions (software developers, user experience designers, product managers) using advanced Boolean logic search strings and  X-Ray search applied to different mediums such as LinkedIn and Twitter;**
- **Experience developing and implementing sourcing strategies to reach underrepresented candidates in support of organizational DE&I efforts;**
- **Experience crafting, testing, and iterating on / reformulating compelling candidate outreach messaging**
- **Maintaining sourced candidate data in spreadsheets or a candidate database equivalent. Experience must include reporting out on metrics related to outreach response rates, conversion of passive to active candidate rates, success rate of various candidate sources (i,e. job boards or events) or percentage of sourced candidates that convert to hires**

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

For each job on your resume, provide:

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)
