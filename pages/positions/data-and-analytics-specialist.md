We are looking for a Data & Analytics Specialist to join the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (CoE) to help develop and improve the capabilities and services of our partner agencies.

The federal government has hundreds of thousands of data sets and managing that data is an extremely challenging task. As a Data & Analytics Specialist, you will help agencies liberate and embrace their data, equip them with profound insights drawn from that data, empowering them to more effectively fulfill their mission. 

Data & Analytics Specialists should not be theoreticians, but rather practitioners in the craft of data science. You’ll need to be able to get hands on when necessary, but we often help partner agencies capitalize on their existing tools and resources or work in tandem with government contractors. It’s imperative that our  Data Analytics Specialist is dedicated to results and has genuine passion about building a sustainable data infrastructure within government. We aspire to not only help our partners solve their problems efficiently and with the ability to scale, but also help them do it in an agile way.

- Inspire honesty and integrity through open communication and liberal knowledge sharing across a multi-disciplinary teams
- Create compelling case studies on how users are benefiting from the program, providing a special focus on lessons learned


### Key objective #3: Practice an exceptional level of customer service with all partners, providing a unique, tailored experience.  

- Explain product or services to people who have varying levels of technical knowledge — always meet the agency partner where they are
- Empathetically guide our agency partners through the bureaucracy of the sometimes long and arduous compliance and security processes 
- Skillfully map specific inquiries to product capabilities, identifying the product that best meets the agency partner’s needs

- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences

## Minimum Qualifications

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you 
meet the Minimum Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the

directly associated your listed work experience.

    work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience
 
The Minimum Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the 
most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/hiring-process/)
