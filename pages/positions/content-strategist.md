## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

As an 18F content strategist, you’ll go far beyond copywriting — you’ll work on cross-functional teams of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, and procurement. Besides creating and maintaining clear, accessible content, you’ll also help our partners improve (or develop) their user-centered content practices and promote content best practices across government.  

The products 18F helps design and create are as varied as the ways the government serves the public. That’s why our content strategists focus on learning from our partners’ expertise and reflecting that to their users in a clear, consistent way even more than they focus on trying to write beautifully. You’ll work with our partners more than for them, so that at the end of an engagement, those partners are in a better position to keep building on the work they came to 18F for in the first place. 

We’re looking for candidates who have delivered content iteratively, who have wrestled with the challenges of producing compelling copy in large organizations that have to balance competing interests, who love to help others discover better ways of creating great content even more than they love writing it. 


## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Lead projects from a content perspective.
- Coach agency partners through the design process and establish a shared vision for the user experience
- Identify user and organizational needs through formal interviews, informal conversations, contextual inquiry, workshops, and analytics research
- Identify content opportunities and make recommendations based on exercises such as content audits, comparative analyses, gap analyses, or site mapping
- Navigate complex organizational relationships to bring stakeholders together around common editorial goals and priorities
- Give agency partners and peers advice they need to hear over what they want to hear, in a manner that respects their intelligence and experience


### Objective #2: Deliver high-quality, user-centered content for agency partners.
- Create clear, accessible, and concise content in a collaborative and iterative environment. This could include landing pages, interface writing, navigation labels, notifications, research findings, or launch materials
- Incorporate continuous feedback from users, peers, and stakeholders by leading content-focused usability and critique sessions
- Maintain consistency with our style and standards in the [18F Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/). Work with partner agencies to evolve their style where appropriate
- Uphold our team values of being clear, concise, inclusive, curious, and honest — in both writing and daily collaboration


### Objective #3: Contribute to the continued success of the content team and shared resources.
- Continually promote 18F’s ways of working by making a strong case for iterative, user-centered design on every project
- Contribute to team-wide resources and training materials, including methods cards, tutorials, guides, presentations, and design toolkits
- Recognize when practices or processes are inconsistent or no longer serve the team, and recommend a way forward to improve effectiveness or efficiency
- Share work in an unfinished state and give peer feedback in weekly critique sessions and drop-in labs
- Promote the practice of content design in workshops, office hours, brown bags, and content-related events, and find ways to raise awareness of the content team’s work among external audiences

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies
- **Content strategy:** Leading strategic content initiatives and delivering effective recommendations for developing user-centered content.
- **User experience (UX) writing:** Planning, writing, and editing content from concept to delivery to make digital services simpler, clearer, and easier to use.
- **Problem solving:** Researching, synthesizing, and designing information to define problems and propose solutions effectively.
- **Collaboration:** Working closely with others to accomplish shared goals and build strong working relationships
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment.


If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}
