## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

As a Talent Acquisition Partner for the Technology Transformation Service (TTS) Talent Team you will play a key role to source, present and hire mission-driven, forward thinking technology leaders who will influence and affect modernization for the federal government and directly the American people. You’ll 
be part of a team responsible for full-cycle recruitment for a range of disciplines including: design (UX, product, and content strategy), engineering (back end, full stack, cloud, infrastructure and site reliability), data science/AI, and product management. You’ll partner with hiring managers to drive recruitment strategies, with an emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion and will ensure that regardless of the hiring outcome, all candidates have a positive experience. 

As a member of the talent team, you should be comfortable navigating bureaucracy and ambiguous situations.  We are an agile team that deals with shifting priorities, policy changes, and time-sensitive projects, initiatives, and hiring needs which require us to be flexible and comfortable with moving in new directions.  Creative problem solving is at the forefront of our work as we find ways to make traditional recruiting efforts meet the unique needs of our organization, and work within policy constraints to improve our practices and processes.

At TTS, hiring is a community effort and the work of the talent team touches all parts of the organization.  This presents an opportunity for our team members to serve as agents of positive change throughout the organization and build a larger community of practice around hiring.  We are a highly collaborative team that supports the work of each member and engages in consensus-driven decision making.  The talent team recognizes and celebrates the individual strengths and interests of our team members, and constantly seeks opportunities for our team members to grow into subject matter experts. 

## Key Objectives

- Source and engage civic-minded candidates by sharing the story of our people, the work we do, and why it matters
- Create recruitment strategies to ensure that TTS’s talent pipeline reflects the diversity of the public we serve
- Act as an ambassador of TTS, representing and delivering our message through information sessions, social media messaging and other forms of passive candidate outreach
- Create an enjoyable candidate experience: deliver personalized interactions and always ensure that candidates are treated like people, not applications 

### Key objective #2: You will develop and institutionalize a comprehensive, equitable, and highly successful recruitment strategy for your discipline. 

- Collaborate with and advise hiring managers on hiring strategies and best practices for matters including creating a pipeline of diverse candidates, implementing equitable screening strategies to reduce (unconscious) bias and navigating the intricacies of Federal hiring authorities. 
- Maintain a deep knowledge of the technology space by staying curious, following news and trends around emerging technologies
- Identify gaps and issues with the hiring process by soliciting feedback from both hiring managers and candidates; use this data to develop solutions
- Work on special projects related to recruiting and the overall hiring experience
- Advocate for more efficient or equitable improvements to Talent’s processes
- Diligently maintain our applicant data and find new ways to use that data to inform the decisions we make

### Key objective #3: You will establish trusting relationships with the TTS team and develop a deep understanding of their projects.

- Maintain consistent lines of communication with the Talent team and hiring managers 
- Establish strong partnerships to build relationships via remote model and genuinely engage with all members of TTS
- Be the champion of both the candidate and hiring manager experience

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. 

Specialized experience must have been obtained in an information technology environment and is defined as experience: 

- Experience developing talent acquisition strategies for filling highly technical positions  (e.g. engineers, product managers, user experience designers) 
- Sourcing for highly technical candidates (e.g. engineers, product managers, user experience designers) using technical sourcing tools such as Boolean search strings and X-Ray search
- Experience developing and implementing sourcing strategies to reach underrepresented candidates in support of organizational DE&I efforts;
- Conducting direct recruitment outreach of highly technical positions (e.g. engineers, product managers, user experience designers) via a variety of methods (e.g. networking, email, social media, events, job postings and cold calling); 
- Able to deliver talent acquisition projects from conception to completion. For example, this may include developing plans and schedules, estimating resource requirements, defining milestones and deliverables, monitoring activities, and evaluating and reporting on accomplishments


Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

For each job on your resume, provide:

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)
