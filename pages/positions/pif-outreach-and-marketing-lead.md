## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

**Brand Strategy and Marketing:** The ability to translate overall business strategy into an actionable brand and marketing strategy.  This includes defining and developing the expression of the value of TTS, and communicate its characteristics and attributes. The ability to market and evangelize that value. 

**Copywriting and Content Development:** The ability to craft storytelling copy conveyed through online media, video and print materials used for the purpose of marketing and building a brand. The ability to develop the information (content) and experience(s) directed toward an end-user or audience. 

**Relationship Management:** Ability to develop and manage relationships with potential agency partners, the public (including the media, congressional members and their staff and industry), and the internal TTS team.

**Analytical Thinking:** Measure the candidate’s ability to think logically, evaluate advantages and disadvantages and to break down and analyze data.

**TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.
