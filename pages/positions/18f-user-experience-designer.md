## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

User experience designers at 18F drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts visually, and work with developers and product managers to build and test them. They foster best practices in user-centered design within 18F and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

UX designers should have deep strength in design research (both generative and evaluative). No one can be equally expert at everything, but in addition to design research, we do expect strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, service design, and information architecture.

As a UX designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. Besides building useful and usable digital services, part of your job will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started.

If you are committed to improving government services by focusing on the people who need them most, this is the position for you.

## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Demonstrate excellence in design research, while grasping the core questions and responsibilities of at least one other UX discipline.

In addition to strong skill in design research, we expect expertise in at least one of the following disciplines:
- **Interaction design:** Define interface logic and behavior, always keeping human behaviors and needs in mind.
- **Information architecture:** Organize and structure complex information to help diverse audiences easily find what they need.
- **Service design:** Improve the relationship of the customer or user and the service provider across all of their interactions and communication channels.

- Zoom in and out. Generate innovative, high-level product strategies as well as the practical project steps and considerations to get there. Are visionary in objective, but pragmatic in approach.
- Support collaborative decision making by telling compelling stories drawn from research that illustrate the pros and cons of various options.
- Show persistent commitment to thoughtful and ethical user research.
- Deliver whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, sitemaps, flowcharts, storyboards, user stories, or interpretive dance.
- Create written materials and visual presentations that are accessible to non-experts but that are legally and technically accurate.
- Incorporate UX into agile development sprints, coordinating with visual and content designers, developers, and product managers to achieve a strategic vision.
- Use modern interaction design patterns and best practices, understanding that there are exceptions to every rule.
- Commit to making what we build fully accessible to the people we serve.

### Objective 2: Advance UX practice

- Clearly communicate user-centered methods and their value to non-designers.
- Mentor and coach colleagues and partners who are taking on new tasks and roles within design and research.
- Share knowledge, techniques, tools, patterns, and expert advice with colleagues, partners, and the public.
- Promote empathy not just for members of the public, but also our partners across the government and our co-workers.

### Objective #3: Work effectively in the federal government

- Skillfully navigate complex organizational relationships to resolve questions.
- Cooperatively negotiate disagreements and mediate compromises.
- Build inclusive, respectful partnerships with diverse groups of people.
- Demonstrate genuine interest in the day-to-day activities that keep our government running.
