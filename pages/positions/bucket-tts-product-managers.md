## Opportunity overview

These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS). TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.

### Role summary
TTS is looking for talented product managers/project managers who will help our partner agencies deliver better digital services to the public. You’ll lead cross-functional teams to solve large, complex problems and deliver user-centered products using agile methodologies and modern software development practices.

TTS is looking for product managers in both client services and product development roles, including:
- Leading cross-functional development teams to own and grow existing, in-market products
- Joining cross-functional teams to partner with other government agencies and help them deliver mission-critical software
- Partnering with government agencies evolve their culture and establish sustainable best practices for product development

These roles will be a great fit for you if you are a:
- Strategic thinker who is comfortable defining a compelling vision and designing a measurable strategy to achieve that vision
- Decisive leader who knows how to motivate cross-functional teams to build the right thing
- Strong executor that is able to deliver results to agencies and the public 

Our ideal candidates will be equally excited about sticky technical issues and intricate human ones. The strongest candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.

If you are interested in any or all of these roles, you should apply. You may be matched with multiple teams across TTS during the interview process based on your skills, experience, and interests.

### Key objectives
**Key objective #1:** Build or steward the product vision and lead end-to-end product development

You are an experienced product manager who can unite vision and execution to lead an interdisciplinary team in delivering the right value to the right people. You’re skilled at defining a meaningful end goal to galvanize your team, whether that means generating a product vision and strategy with your team or helping agency partners articulate and focus their vision and strategy.

Successful product managers at TTS:
- Establish a vision and ensure all team members and stakeholders have a shared understanding of product objectives, goals, and metrics
- Analyze market demand and market fit, do competitive analysis, and guide build vs. buy or reuse approaches
- Create a product strategy and roadmap and develop a communications strategy supporting product goals
- Identify and proactively monitor and address product risks
- Lead or facilitate a cross-functional team of researchers, designers, and engineers to ensure the right product is delivered to the right audience
- Work with the team to set and meet quality standards for any product you build
- Use evidence (user research, analytics, and other metrics) to make product decisions, ask “why” a lot, and recognize the difference between “we can’t do that because of bureaucracy” and “we can’t do that because of the law”
- Energize and motivate the team by recognizing successes and learning from failures
- Ensure that products comply with federal regulations such as Authority to Operate, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and Section 508

**Key objective #2:** Support agency partners in delivering results to the public

As a product manager at TTS, your job isn’t to deliver software; your job is to create sustainable outcomes that benefit the public. You’ll uphold a modern product development mindset and make sure every project you touch is set up for sustained long-term success. As part of that, you’ll share your expertise and experience with your teammates and stakeholders in order to ensure that you are not a single point of success.

Successful product managers at TTS:
- Help partners understand how to deliver value, rather than features, to their users
- Help teammates and stakeholders navigate complex bureaucratic relationships to bring stakeholders together around a common product vision and strategy
- Advocate for and explain agile, open source, and user-centered principles so that teammates, stakeholders, and government partners understand the value these practices bring
- Improve the government’s product management capacity by coaching and mentoring more junior product managers
- Work with partners to establish relationships with their security, operations, and IT teams that will help sustain the product in the long term
- Work with teammates and stakeholders to develop communications strategies to sustain the product in the short and long term

**Key objective #3:** You’ll meet customer expectations, along with personal and organizational goals. You’ll produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risk.
- Hold yourself and your team accountable for measurable, high-quality, timely, and cost-effective results
- Demonstrate your credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes
- Meet the needs of internal and external customers
- Make well-informed, effective, and timely decisions
- Identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner
- Explain technical issues and concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

**Key objective #4:** You’ll lead change, both within and outside the organization, to meet organizational goals. You’ll help establish an organizational vision and implement it in a continuously changing environment.
- Develop new insights into situations and question conventional approaches
- Develop, implement, and drive technical strategy in engineering-specific and organization-wide contexts
- Keep up-to-date on policies and trends that affect the organization and shape stakeholders’ views
- Adapt to change and quickly integrate new information
- Formulate and execute consistently against objectives and priorities
- Take a long-term view and build a shared vision with people across TTS, GSA, and across the US Government
