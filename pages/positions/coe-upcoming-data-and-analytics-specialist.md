## Role Summary

### Data & Analytics Specialist (GS15)

We are looking for a Data & Analytics Specialist to join the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence (COE) to help develop and improve the capabilities and services of our partner agencies.

The federal government has hundreds of thousands of data sets and managing that data is an extremely challenging task. As Service Delivery Analytics Specialist, you will help agencies liberate and embrace their data, equip them with profound insights drawn from that data, empowering them to more effectively fulfill their mission.

Data & Analytics Specialists should not be theoreticians, but rather practitioners in the craft of data science. You’ll also need to be able to get hands on when necessary but we often help partner agencies capitalize on their existing tools and resources or work in tandem with government contractors. It’s imperative that our Data & Analytics Specialist is dedicated to results and has genuine passion about building a sustainable data infrastructure within government. We aspire to not only help our partners solve their problems efficiently and with the ability to scale, but also help them do it in an agile way.
