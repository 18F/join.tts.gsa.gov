## Role Summary: 

### Visual Designer GS-14

Visual designers on the experience design team at 18F craft highly usable and beautiful digital experiences for audiences inside and outside of government. Our clients are agencies of the U.S. government, and our work must reflect and help preserve the integrity of our national image. Our visual designers collaborate with agency partners, product managers, other designers, and engineers to establish and evolve design patterns which make our work consistent and efficient. 

Visual designers will foster best practices in user-centered visual design systems within 18F/TTS and across the federal government through product delivery, advocacy, and coaching. 

We're looking for candidates who have visual identity and design system experience along with a background in at least one other user-centered design discipline such as communications/content design, front end design, interaction design, or service design on digital teams that practice agile or iterative delivery.


<div class="paragraph"><p><br>
<br></p></div>

## Key Objectives

### Objective #1: Lead projects from a visual design perspective.
- Coach agency partners through the visual design process and establish a shared vision for the user experience.
- Identify user and organizational needs through formal interviews, informal conversations, contextual inquiry, workshops, and analytics research.
- Identify visual design opportunities through exercises such as brand/interface audits, comparative or competitive analyses, gap analyses, and system mapping, and make recommendations based on what you discover.
- Navigate complex organizational relationships to bring stakeholders together around shared design systems or visual identity goals and priorities.
- Give agency partners and peers advice they need to hear versus what they want to hear, in a manner that respects their intelligence and experience.

### Objective #2: Deliver high-quality, user-centered visual design for agency partners.
- Create clear, inclusive, accessible, and extensible visual styles and components in a fast-paced, collaborative environment. Examples include selecting and applying appropriate styles from the U.S. Web Design System, building interface patterns, looks-like/works-like prototypes, landing pages, logo and identity designs, brand or design principles, pattern libraries, research findings with visual storytelling, and product launch materials.
- Iterate quickly by collaborating on prototypes at various levels of fidelity.
- Incorporate continuous feedback from users, peers, and stakeholders by leading design-focused usability and critique sessions.
- Implement style changes in GitHub, or pair with engineers to implement and review them collaboratively. Make visual design work visible in shared project management tools.
- Uphold our team values of being clear, concise, inclusive, curious, and honest — in both your designs and daily collaboration.


### Objective #3: Contribute to the continued success of the visual design team and shared resources.
- Continually promote 18F’s ways of working by making a strong case for iterative, user-centered design on every project.
- Contribute to team-wide resources and training materials, including tutorials, guides, presentations, and design toolkits.
- Recognize when practices or processes are inconsistent or no longer serve the team, and recommend a way forward to improve effectiveness or efficiency.
- Share your work in an unfinished state and give peer feedback in weekly critique sessions and drop-in labs.
- Learn about accessible and inclusive visual design practices and evangelize them throughout your work and partnerships.
- Promote the practice of visual design in workshops, office hours, brown bags, and design-related events.
- Write and publish conversational blog posts to raise awareness about the team’s work and promote the 18F brand.
