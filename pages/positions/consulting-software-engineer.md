## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

18F is looking for talented software developers who will help our partner agencies deliver better digital services to the public. As a Consulting Engineer at 18F, you will be a builder, contributor, and catalyst. Working with folks across the organization, you will solve large, complex problems while promoting user-centered, open, and transparent culture. The role involves diverse responsibilities — you might be writing code one day, meeting with members from partner agencies another day, and launching a new product that will impact the lives of Americans across the country the next week. [18F is an open-source team](https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/07/29/18f-an-open-source-team/), so most of what you work on will be open source.

This role may be perfect for you if you have the technical skills to tackle engineering problems, the social skills to face human-factors problems, and the judgment to differentiate between the two. Our ideal candidate will be equally excited about sticky technical issues and intricate human ones. Impact in this role can’t be measured on a GitHub contribution graph; ideal candidates should be equally comfortable solving technical problems by writing code, explaining technical design architecture to technical and less technical folks alike, and leading organizational strategy and change.

18F’s core languages are Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and Go. You should have strong, demonstrable experience with at least one of these languages and should be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. The strongest candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.

## Key Objectives

### Key objective #1: You’ll contribute high-quality, well-tested, maintainable code across an entire project lifecycle, using best practices for modern software development.

- Practice and enthusiastically share engineering methodologies and tools throughout all stages of the project lifecycle
- Influence project planning and design using usability research, analytics, and other metrics
- Participate in code review, architecture discussions, and feature prioritization
- Take pride of ownership in all projects you touch; leave code better than you found it
- Contribute to documentation, tests, style fixes, accessibility, performance, security, and more
- Deliver code that’s easy to deploy, update, and monitor by ensuring that the necessary tooling is present early in the project development cycle or by introducing tooling into an existing project, as needed

### Key objective #2: You’ll positively contribute to the culture and knowledge of the engineering team, practicing and enthusiastically sharing agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.

- Work within a distributed, multidisciplinary agile team by participating in constructive discussions, openly sharing knowledge, and demonstrating value for technical and non-technical contributions
- Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences
- Provide visibility into each project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it
- Demonstrate a strong understanding of the elements of agile methodology (scrum, kanban, and so on)
- Practice human-centered design, user testing, feature prioritization, DevOps, and other relevant concepts

### Key objective #3: You’ll meet customer expectations, along with personal and organizational goals. You’ll produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risk.

- Hold yourself and your team accountable for measurable, high-quality, timely, and cost-effective results
- Demonstrate your credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes
- Meet the needs of internal and external customers
- Make well-informed, effective, and timely decisions
- Identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner
- Explain technical issues and concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

### Key objective #4: You’ll lead change, both within and outside the organization, to meet organizational goals. You’ll help establish an organizational vision and implement it in a continuously changing environment.

- Develop new insights into situations and question conventional approaches
- Develop, implement, and drive technical strategy in engineering-specific and organization-wide contexts
- Keep up-to-date on policies and trends that affect the organization and shape stakeholders’ views
- Adapt to change and quickly integrate new information
- Formulate and execute consistently against objectives and priorities
- Take a long-term view and build a shared vision with people across TTS, GSA, and across the US Government
