## Opportunity overview

These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS). TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.

We will be interviewing and hiring for this role on an ongoing basis and to help navigate the process, we’ve created a [guide](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/rolling-hiring/) to help explain what to expect after submitting your resume.

## Role summary

Designers at TTS work across design contexts. They drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts clearly, and work with cross functional teams to build and test them. They model best practices in user-centered design within TTS and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

Our Designers have deep experience in user research (generative, foundational and evaluative). In addition to research, we look for strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, product design, service design, content design and/or information architecture.

As a Designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams made up of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition to building useful and usable digital services, you will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started.

If you are committed to improving government services for all who need them this is the position for you.

Types of designers we are currently hiring for:
- UX Design
- Service Design
- Content Strategy
