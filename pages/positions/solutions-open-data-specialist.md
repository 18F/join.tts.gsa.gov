## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position.
There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work
experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've
  ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on
  creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Software Engineering Technical Experience:** Deliver technical solutions and products using software engineering technology
- **Software Engineering Practices:** Deliver innovative technical solutions and products using established engineering best practices
- **Communication:** Communicate effectively with a variety of audiences, particularly in consulting scenarios, to establish a shared vision and understanding of a
project’s technical implementation, objectives and goals
- **Technical Strategy:** Advising on technical strategy, agile development, software tools, and technical architecture
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or
Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. Specialized
experience is:

1. Extensive experience in government open data efforts, data management, data and metadata standards, data usage and impact, and related policy issues

2. Expertise in coordinating government-wide initiatives and implementing federal policies

3. Demonstrated skill and experience in directing efforts to deliver improvements in website design and performance

4. Knowledge and experience in information technology security requirements applicable to federal government websites and applying skills to secure operations of federal websites

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in
disqualification.

For each job on your resume, provide:

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)

## Next Steps

After the closing date/deadline:
1. **ELIGIBILITY/QUALIFICATIONS:** Applicant eligibility and qualifications are reviewed.
2. **REFERRAL TO MANAGEMENT:** Eligible/Qualified applicants are referred to management for review and possible interview.
3. **SELECTION/TENTATIVE JOB OFFER:** If a selection is made, a Tentative Offer is extended to the selectee and suitability and/or security background investigation is conducted.
4. **FINAL JOB OFFER:** A final job offer is made (typically within 40 days after the closing date/deadline for applications).
5. **FINAL COMMUNICATION TO APPLICANTS:** Once the position is filled, we will notify all applicants of their final status. You may check your status by logging into USAJOBS. Go to My USAJOBS and then to Applications.
