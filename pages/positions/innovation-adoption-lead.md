## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

The Centers of Excellence work with partner agencies to accelerate IT modernization by leveraging private sector innovation and government services. We work primarily in six areas: Infrastructure Optimization, Cloud Adoption, Data & Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Contact Centers, and Customer Experience. Our complementary work in strategic communications, change management, and performance management ensures these innovations can be successful and sustainable. We also work with partner agencies to enhance their ability to innovate so they can continuously modernize as opportunities and challenges emerge over time.

The Innovation Adoption Lead is a multi-faceted role, which means your work will involve delivering outputs for several audiences.  This includes:
- managing innovation adoption work for partner agency customers, including some acquisition work and managing contract resources; 
- creating and managing internal protocols and internal initiatives for the Centers of Excellence organization; and 
- developing and promoting Centers of Excellence practices as part of the organization’s body of knowledge and its broader method set for innovation adoption.

The selected candidate will serve on the cross-functional Strategic Management Team, engaging with peers on all four strategic management agendas:
- **Change Management**, from the tradition to the alternative, to help us ensure that our IT modernization projects are successful and sustainable
- **Development**, from workforce development to skills development, to help ensure that people modernize their work and capabilities while systems and tools get their own makeover
- **Internal Communications**, from communications strategy to channels to messaging, to help us ensure that people receive the information and inspiration they need and have the opportunity to contribute their own insights and experiences 
- **Performance Management & Improvement**, from the organization to teams to individuals, to help us ensure that we set clear, shared goals and can demonstrate progress and results through data and evidence

## Key Objectives

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Innovation Adoption Expertise:** Ability to apply innovative contact center tools and technologies and to help guide agency partners in making strategic & tactical innovative decisions.
- **Leadership:** Ability to effectively inspire and lead cross-functional teams to meet the project vision and shared objectives of agency partner organizations, while simultaneously providing support and guidance to all members of the partner agency. 
- **Agile Orientation:** Ability to apply agile and open source philosophies to deliver work in a frequent and iterative fashion to address user needs. 
- **Communication:** Ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences, particularly in consulting scenarios, to establish a shared vision and understanding of a project’s technical implementation, objectives and goals.
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Ability to work with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment.

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.
