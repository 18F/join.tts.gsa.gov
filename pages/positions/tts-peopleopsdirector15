TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with innovative products, platforms, and services.

## Role Summary

The People Operations team at TTS owns the relationship and experience with staff and supervisors for all things talent (other than hiring) starting when an employee comes on-board through an employee off-boarding. They are experts in people related policy, regulations and bureaucratic requirements.  They create and maintain the infrastructure and support that’s needed to meet the requirements of hiring and working within the federal government. Moreover, they seek to create an environment where our people can focus on the work that matters, one where our people spend as little time as possible thinking about the mundane details of working (compensation, benefits, moving, etc.) and make sure they have everything they need to do great work.

As the People Operations Director, you will oversee areas of Business Operations including performance management, events and training management, travel, personnel action requests, leave and time management, purchasing, career progression frameworks and supervisor training and development.
