## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

18F is an office within the General Services Administration (GSA) that partners with federal agencies to build and buy digital services that improve the public’s experience with government services. Composed of a team of 100+ experienced, mid to senior-level cross-functional tech consultants who enable and empower federal, state and local agencies to design, develop, buy, and deploy human-centered technological solutions— meeting users’ expectations and urgent mission needs now, not years from now.

You will lead and direct the company's operations and give strategic guidance to ensure that the company achieves its mission and objectives.

- Provides advice and consultation in the development of policies, plans, and practices that may result in government-wide impact and growth
- Utilizes current business data to forecast and plan for the supply/demand of hiring and resource goals to meet internal organization and client objectives.


### Objective #2: Builds and maintains effective internal and external working relationships to address issues of mutual interest with federal agencies, top agency management, municipal and state agencies, foreign governments, subject matter experts, industry and other high level officials across public, not-for-profit and private sectors. 

- Chief ambassador of the 18F program and associated projects to appropriate audiences through speeches, presentations, articles for publication, newsletters; identifies, reviews and collaborates on blog posts, articles for trade journals, scholarly journals and periodicals to highlight transformation and business performance across 18F and TTS.
- Builds a communication and relationship strategy on how best to engage with GSA officials and other agencies and departments in order to carry out 18F strategy, planning, and acquisition initiatives that have government-wide implications.
- Collaborates with federal agencies on relevant projects, policies, and initiatives.
- Acts as thought leader/subject matter expert on digital innovation and technology transformation within the federal government.


### Objective #3: Provides executive leadership and EEO responsibility.

- Manages 18F’s division directors, providing leadership and mentoring. 
- Fosters the development of employees through empowerment, two-way communication and facilitates cooperation and teamwork. 
- Furthers diversity within 18F via recruitment, hiring, training, awards, and active participation with Employee Resource Groups, resulting in an inclusive, - equitable and diverse workplace.
