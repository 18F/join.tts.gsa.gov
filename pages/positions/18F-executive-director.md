- Utilizes current business data to forecast and plan for the supply/demand of hiring and resource goals to meet internal organization and client objectives.


### Objective #2: Builds and maintains effective internal and external working relationships to address issues of mutual interest with federal agencies, top agency management, municipal and state agencies, foreign governments, subject matter experts, industry and other high level officials across public, not-for-profit and private sectors. 

- Chief ambassador of the 18F program and associated projects to appropriate audiences through speeches, presentations, articles for publication, newsletters; identifies, reviews and collaborates on blog posts, articles for trade journals, scholarly journals and periodicals to highlight transformation and business performance across 18F and TTS.

- Collaborates with federal agencies on relevant projects, policies, and initiatives.
- Acts as thought leader/subject matter expert on digital innovation and technology transformation within the federal government.


### Objective #3: Provides executive leadership and EEO responsibility.

- Fosters the development of employees through empowerment, two-way communication and facilitates cooperation and teamwork. 
- Furthers diversity within 18F via recruitment, hiring, training, awards, and active participation with Employee Resource Groups, resulting in an inclusive, - equitable and diverse workplace.
