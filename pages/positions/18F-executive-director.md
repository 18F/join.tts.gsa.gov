## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

18F is an office within the General Services Administration (GSA) that partners with federal agencies to build and buy digital services that improve the public’s experience with government services. Composed of a team of 100+ experienced, mid to senior-level cross-functional tech consultants who enable and empower federal, state and local agencies to design, develop, buy, and deploy human-centered technological solutions— meeting users’ expectations and urgent mission needs now, not years from now. 

The Executive Director of 18F oversees this federal employee digital consultancy whose mission is to improve the lives of the public and public servants by transforming how the government uses technology. You will lead and direct the company's operations and give strategic guidance to ensure that the company achieves its mission and objectives.

- Developing actionable modernization roadmaps and a plan to prioritize and implement them
- Building or redesigning websites, products, platforms or tools to better meet the needs of partners and the public
- Using small and modular contracts to de-risk procurement and better manage vendors

Sometimes this looks like longer-term enablement:

- Business process redesign to help partners achieve better outcomes
- Helping partners build their own digital capacity so they can own and implement their tech roadmaps and outsourcing strategies

### Objective #2: Builds and maintains effective internal and external working relationships to address issues of mutual interest with federal agencies, top agency management, municipal and state agencies, foreign governments, subject matter experts, industry and other high level officials across public, not-for-profit and private sectors. 

- Chief ambassador of the 18F program and associated projects to appropriate audiences through speeches, presentations, articles for publication, newsletters; identifies, reviews and collaborates on blog posts, articles for trade journals, scholarly journals and periodicals to highlight transformation and business performance across 18F and TTS.
- Builds a communication and relationship strategy on how best to engage with GSA officials and other agencies and departments in order to carry out 18F strategy, planning and acquisition initiatives that have government-wide implications.
- Collaborates with federal agencies on relevant projects, policies, and initiatives.
