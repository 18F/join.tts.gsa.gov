## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

Login.gov gives the public simple, secure access to multiple government services through one verified account. Login.gov has
over 10 million users and is growing the team as we scale quickly.

Login.gov is looking for qualified Site Reliability / DevOps engineers to join our infrastructure team. We care deeply about
providing the best possible experience to anyone using government digital services and we are committed to making the process
of accessing government services easy while combating fraud and abuse. A qualified candidate is ready to quickly jump in and
help in a number of areas: using site reliability engineering best practices to build and operate the Login.gov 
infrastructure at scale, responding to incidents and leading incident response and postmortem review, creating automation 
in areas such as security compliance and code deployment, and meeting with engineers and executives from prospective 
government agency customers to determine how Login.gov can adapt to meet their user identity needs.

The Login.gov team operates like a startup within the government, working in the open as a distributed, agile team. The core
product is open source, hosted in modern cloud infrastructure, and built for scale. Tens of millions of people have Login.gov
accounts, and we aim to be the preferred entrypoint for all government digital services. Our users today include people 
accessing benefits, applying for government jobs, serving in the military, and collecting funds awarded through grant 
programs.

As part of the Login.gov infrastructure engineering team, you will play a key role in making government services more secure
and accessible to the public.

- Conduct load tests to ensure the application is ready to handle projected user traffic
- Improve automation and fault tolerance of the deployment process
- Drive long-term improvement in Login.gov system availability by removing single points of failure

### Objective #3: Collaborate with the Login.gov team and outside partners:

- Handle site issues from partner agencies, dealing both with engineers and non-engineers
- Oversee procurement process for tools and services used by Login.gov
- Work alongside talent specialists to continue hiring new engineers and project managers into the team
- Advocate for modern information security principles throughout the system
