## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

Contracting Specialists — members of the TTS Office of Acquisition Team — possess two key qualities: excellent judgment and an unflinching belief that federal procurement can be joyful. Applicants for this position must either currently be employed in the 1102 Job Series or be qualified for [placement in this job series](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1100/contracting-series-1102/) in compliance with OPM regulations.

Although a technology background isn’t a requirement for this position, it would be very helpful. Lightheartedness and empathy are requirements for this role.

Contracting Specialists participate in three primary activities within TTS: assisting other agencies with digital-service-related procurements; conducting analyses and evaluations of other agencies’ existing acquisition “stacks” to help identify opportunities to improve results; and working on internal procurements and serving as warranted Contracting Officers (COs) for TTS purchases.

As a Contracting Specialist, you’ll work alongside a focused, cross-functional team of other digital service specialists — experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition, you’ll become part of the broader TTS network, which includes more than 200 digital specialists.

If you’ve read the [TechFAR](https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) and believe that the government can buy digital services in a better way, this is the position for you.

## Key Objectives

### Key objective #1: Transform how the government procures digital services.

- Serve as an operational Contracting Specialist (CS) and/or warranted CO to buy supplies and services for TTS clients.
- Help partner agencies, through the RFP Ghostwriting process, shape their acquisition documents to reflect best practices in digital-services procurement.
- Collaborate with cross-functional consulting teams to promote modernization efforts within partner agencies; help implement agile development practices.
- Assist, on behalf of TTS and partner agencies, in the procurement of digital services over the procurement lifecycle.


### Key objective #2: Help diversify government’s buying options by creating new contract processes and creatively using existing legal authorities.

- Help establish vendor marketplaces across multiple domains and partner agencies.
- Develop new ways for TTS and partner agencies to work with the vendor community to achieve shared success.
- Use FAR-based and non-FAR-based authorities (America Competes Act, among others) to award contracts and advise agencies on opportunities for great digital service outcomes.


### Promote the adoption of modern technology practices in government through contracting, research, and knowledge sharing.

- Develop hypotheses, tests, and findings to improve the procurement of digital services.
- Contribute to great client outcomes by performing contract administration for TTS.contracts and working alongside the Acquisition Management and Oversight Division from award to closeout.
- Perform market research on cutting-edge digital services and products to aid internal and external clients with acquisition strategy and planning.
- Draft acquisition packages; use a Contract Writing System to award contracts to the extent necessary for the Service.
- Solicit, evaluate, negotiate, and award contracts for TTS
- Provide effective contract administration and post-award management.
- Maintain Contracting Officer warrant and relevant certifications by teaching seminars/presentations and enrolling in relevant classes that grant CLPs.
- Write periodic  posts for the [18F Blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/blog/) on important acquisition topics and client case studies.
