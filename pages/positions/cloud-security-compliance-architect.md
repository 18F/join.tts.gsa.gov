## Role Summary:

### {{ page.role_name }} - GS-{{ page.gs_level }}

cloud.gov, a product team within 18F, is looking for a security compliance architect to help us deliver better digital services to the public. You will be a builder, contributor, and a catalyst. With the support of our team of about 15 people, you will solve large complex problems while spreading user-centered, open, and secure culture. [cloud.gov is an open source team](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/repos/), so much of what you work on will be open source. Our team is excited to tackle challenging problems to improve the lives of others. We care about respect and listening to each other.

Our vision is to help federal government teams radically reduce the time and labor of the ATO process while fulfilling security requirements and improving security. We do this by providing a modern and cloud-native Platform as a Service (hosted on Infrastructure as a Service) with a FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board Provisional ATO at the Moderate level. Our cloud.gov customer systems inherit much of their security compliance from our system. Your role is critical to this vision, and your work will include:

- Lead maintenance of the cloud.gov P-ATO
- Help team members and customers understand security compliance
- Improve how cloud.gov supports and accelerates customer compliance
- Publish open source compliance materials and explanations, for reuse and learning by teams in the public and private sectors

This is an Information Systems Security Officer role, so it’s great if you have experience as an ISSO or equivalent. You should have strong technical writing skills. You should be able to explain the security value of engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. You should have experience making recommendations to engineering and leadership team members. You do not need to write code — it’s more important to be able to write policies and procedures. The best candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.

- Coordinate with cloud.gov Product Manager, engineering team members, and other team members (including Director and Deputy Director) to explain FedRAMP requirements and plan and prioritize team tasks to fulfill those requirements.
- Identify internal security compliance needs and issues, and coordinate resolving those issues by working constructively with the rest of the team.
- Collaborate with team members to interpret, implement, and document requirements in ways that prioritize secure engineering best practices, not simply checking checkboxes.
- Contribute to our procurement process for compliance-related services and products, such as our 3PAO contracts.
- Run cloud.gov team compliance trainings, security review meetings, incident response exercises, and other required security compliance meetings in ways that engage and educate our team.
- Participate in team security incident response and contingency plan response processes, including as Incident Commander when needed.

### Key objective #3: Teach and collaborate with customers, fellow teams, and the public.

- Identify and contribute to ways that cloud.gov can support and accelerate customer compliance, such as new tools, templates, and training.
- Participate in cloud.gov business development calls and customer support email threads to answer customer questions related to security compliance.
- Serve as the cloud.gov liaison to our division’s team that handles larger infrastructure and compliance topics.
- Participate in cross-team working groups for security and compliance, which provide informal advising and learning.
- Publish our compliance documents as open source materials for reuse by the public, with appropriate security risk management part of our vision is to publish most of our System Security Plan.

### Key objective #4: Contribute to the culture and knowledge of the team, practicing and sharing agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle. 

- Work within a distributed, multidisciplinary agile team by participating in constructive discussions, sharing knowledge, and demonstrating value for technical and non-technical contributions. 
- Support a safe, inclusive, respectful workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences.

## Application Evaluation

The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:

1. Only applications found "minimally qualified" are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed
2. The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that's directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
  - Examples of stuff that can't be used:
    - Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be "directly" on the resume but the information is not).
    - Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience
    - Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience

  The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It's best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you've ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on [Join TTS Hiring Process]({{site.baseurl}}/resume/)

{% endif %}  

{% if page.state != 'upcoming' %}

## Evaluation

We will use a method called Category Rating to assess your application.

**Here’s how it will work:**

You will be scored based on a review of your application materials, measuring your possession of each of the following competencies

- **Technical Fluency:** The ability to assimilate and synthesize highly technical information and then effectively communicate that information to audiences with a wide range of technical familiarity
- **Communication:** Ability to communicate effectively with a variety of audiences, particularly consulting clients/partners, to establish a shared vision and understanding of a project’s technical implementation, objectives and goals.
- **Teamwork & Collaboration:** The ability to work cooperatively with others to accomplish objectives and build inclusive and mutually-beneficial partnerships
- **Problem Solving:** The ability to design, analyze, synthesize and/or evaluate information to produce and defend a desired solution.
- **TTS Core Values Alignment:** Working with integrity, transparency and resiliency in civic minded or high impact environment

If found to be eligible and at least minimally qualified for the position, your score will be used to place you in a category (Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified).

If your resume does not support your possession of the competencies listed above, we may lower your score, which could place you in a lower category.

Within each category, veterans will receive selection priority over non-veterans if supported by appropriate documentation.

{% endif %}

## Qualifications

All applications will be reviewed by a panel of subject matter experts against a scoring rubric created for this role. In
order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.

To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-{{ page.gs_level | minus: 1 }} in the Federal service. Specialized experience is:

1. Experience managing security compliance responsibilities. This experience must include **ALL** of the following:
- Working with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements
- Serving as a lead of a security compliance documentation process
- Writing or editing security compliance documentation

2. Experience being a part of a team to deliver digital products or services. 

3. Experience using agile methodologies.

Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.

For each job on your resume, provide:

- the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)
- number of hours per week you worked (if part time)
