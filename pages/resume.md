Unlike private-sector resumes, government-style resumes are often several pages long and include detailed information about the jobs you've held, your responsibilities, and what you accomplished.

## General recommendations

- When you are preparing your application, be sure to reference the Qualifications & Evaluation sections of the job post to help you best frame your experience.
- Don’t get hung up on trying to match specific formatting just make sure you’ve included the information relevant to each section.
- Be as detailed as possible, length is not an issue as long as the information you are including is relevant.
- For your most relevant, recent, or longest held position, list 8-10 bullet points about your responsibilities and accomplishments. For each prior position, you can list fewer points focusing on the information that is most relevant to the job you are applying to.
- Don’t be afraid to use technical terminology if it’s relevant to your role or the role you are applying to but avoid acronyms and abbreviations where possible.
- We don’t use any kind of automated screening tools, your application will be evaluated by humans who will have varying levels of familiarity with the details of the roles. Although it’s not a key-word search, better to be explicit and not assume the reader has the domain knowledge or context to “read between the lines”.
- Quantify as much as possible (where applicable)
