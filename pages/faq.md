Thank you for your interest in a position with TTS! Below you will find some of the most commonly asked questions from prospective applicants and new hires.  

## Hiring and Application FAQ

### Can I set up a call with a TTS recruiter to learn more about working at TTS?
- Although we cannot set up 1:1 calls with prospective candidates, we do host monthly information sessions that include plenty of time to answer questions. You can find a list of our upcoming sessions on the [JoinTTS homepage](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/). 
- You can also find info on [Working at TTS](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/working-at-tts/) and a [description of our offices](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/tts-offices/).

### Where can I find your open positions?   
- All of our open and upcoming roles are posted on the [JoinTTS homepage](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/). You can also [subscribe to our mailing list](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/newsletter/) if you would like to be notified when new roles open.

### What if I don’t see any roles posted that I’m eligible for?
- We recommend you sign up for [job alerts](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/newsletter/) to stay in the loop for any future openings that may align with your experience and interests. 

### Do you have any entry-level opportunities?
- Due to the nature of the work we do, many of our opportunities require previous work experience. We do, however, have an early‑career technology opportunity for recent graduates with the U.S. Digital Corps (USDC) Program. You can learn more about this 2-year fellowship opportunity on the [USDC website](https://digitalcorps.gsa.gov/opportunity/). 

### Do you have any tips on preparing a federal style resume? 
- Yes! We recommend checking out the [preparing your resume section](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/resume/) of the JoinTTS website, as well as a [sample resume](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/hiring-staying-or-changing-jobs/resume/) in our Handbook that was created by a TTS employee.

### I applied for a role, what happens next?
- A TTS recruiter will reach out to candidates who have been selected for an interview. Depending on the size of the applicant pool, this may take several weeks. Unfortunately, we are not able to provide status updates on applications and are unable to give feedback to candidates who are not selected to interview.

### What is the difference between a TTS recruiter and a GSA Human Resources representative (HR Specialist)? 
- A TTS recruiter will reach out to you if you are selected to interview. They will coordinate your interviews and help you prepare for the process, including sharing interview questions ahead of time. 
- If you are selected for an offer,  you will be connected to a GSA HR Specialist who will extend your tentative job offer. They will also work with you to complete your onboarding forms and ensure you are moving forward in the onboarding process.

### I was selected for a position and GSA HR contacted me with a tentative job offer. What happens next?
- After you accept your tentative job offer:
  - HR will ask you to complete some required forms via GSA’s HR Portal.  You must complete these forms as a first step. 
  - Once the forms are completed, you will need to get your fingerprints taken. Your HR rep will provide additional information regarding this step. 
  - Once your fingerprints are completed, HR will submit your documentation to GSA’s Security Team, who will work with you on completing your Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Please complete your e-QIP within two weeks.  
  - GSA Security will release your information to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Once OPM reviews and approves your package, you will be granted “Initial Access” and your HR rep will reach out to extend your final job offer and work with you to determine a start date.
  - Note: “Initial Access” is required for you to start your work as a federal employee, but it is not the final step of background investigations. Your full background investigation may continue for several months. You will receive an email once the investigation is complete. 
  - ***Please note, we do not recommend giving notice to your employer before receiving your final offer.***

### When will I receive my final offer?
- Once you have cleared security (after getting your fingerprints taken, submitting your e-QIP, etc), your HR contact will reach out to you to provide your final offer and work out a start date. 
- ***Please note, we do not recommend giving notice to your employer before receiving your final offer.***
