<h2 id="application-evaluation">Application Evaluation</h2>

<p>The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Only applications found “minimally qualified” are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed</li>
  <li>The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that’s directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.
    <ul>
      <li>Examples of stuff that can’t be used:</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Links to portfolios or other external materials (Yes, the links themselves may be “directly” on the resume but the information is not).</li>
      <li>Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience</li>
      <li>Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The Qualification process is a bureaucratic requirement that we are stuck with. It’s best to think about it as the most intense and rigorous resume review you’ve ever heard of. To get through this process you need make sure your resume directly reflects the Qualifications listed below. We also have more guidance on creating a federal style resume on <a href="/resume/">Join TTS Hiring Process</a></p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>

<p>In order to properly be able to evaluate your previous experience, we recommend being as detailed as possible in your resume
and following our general guidance on creating federal style resume.</p>

<p>To qualify for this role, you must have one year of specialized experience equivalent to the GS-13 in the Federal service.</p>

<p>Specialized experience is defined as experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experience managing staff that provide or support delivery of modern IT product(s), platform(s), or service(s).</li>
  <li>Experience leading  the overall planning, management, and direction of a program or of projects.</li>
  <li>Experience in one, or more, of the following technology disciplines: software engineering, product management, design, data science &amp; analytics, or cybersecurity.</li>
  <li>Experience with agile or iterative development methodologies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Qualification determinations cannot be made when resumes do not include the required information, so failure to provide this information may result in disqualification.</p>

<p>For each job on your resume, provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the exact dates you held each job (from month/year to month/year or “present”)</li>
  <li>number of hours per week you worked (if part time)</li>
</ul>
