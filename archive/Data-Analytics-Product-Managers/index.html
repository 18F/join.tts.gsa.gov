You’ll lead cross-functional teams to solve large, complex problems and deliver user-centered products using agile methodologies and modern software development practices.</p>

<p>TTS is looking for product managers in both client services and product development roles, including:</p>

<p>If you are interested in any or all of these roles, you should apply. You may be matched with multiple teams across TTS during the interview process based on your skills, experience, and interests.</p>

<h2 id="key-objectives">Key objectives</h2>

<p><strong>1. Build or steward the product vision and lead end-to-end product development.</strong>
You are an experienced product manager who can unite vision and execution to lead an interdisciplinary team in delivering the right value to the right people. You’re skilled at defining a meaningful end goal to galvanize your team, whether that means generating a product vision and strategy with your team or helping agency partners articulate and focus their vision and strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish a vision and ensure all team members and stakeholders have a shared understanding of product objectives, goals, and metrics</li>
  <li>Analyze market demand and market fit, do competitive analysis, and guide build vs. buy or reuse approaches</li>

  <li>Identify and proactively monitor and address product risks</li>
  <li>Lead or facilitate a cross-functional team of researchers, designers, and engineers to ensure the right product is delivered to the right audience</li>
  <li>Work with the team to set and meet quality standards for any product you build</li>
  <li>Use evidence (user research, analytics, and other metrics) to make product decisions, ask “why” a lot, and recognize the difference between “we can’t do that because of bureaucracy” and “we can’t do that because of the law”</li>
  <li>Energize and motivate the team by recognizing successes and learning from failures</li>
  <li>Ensure that products comply with federal regulations such as the 21st Century IDEA Act, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA), and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Support agency partners in delivering results to the public.</strong>
As a product manager at TTS, you’ll uphold a modern product development mindset and make sure every project you touch is set up for sustained long-term success. As part of that, you’ll share your expertise and experience with your teammates and stakeholders in order to ensure that you are not a single point of success.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Help partners understand how to deliver value, rather than features, to their users</li>
  <li>Help teammates and stakeholders navigate complex bureaucratic relationships to bring stakeholders together around a common product vision and strategy</li>
  <li>Advocate for and explain agile, open source, and user-centered principles so that teammates, stakeholders, and government partners understand the value these practices bring</li>

  <li>Demonstrate your credibility in your area of expertise, deliver high-quality work, and accept responsibility for mistakes</li>
  <li>Meet the needs of internal and external customers</li>
  <li>Make well-informed, effective, and timely decisions</li>
  <li>Identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner</li>
  <li>Explain technical issues and concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Lead in your program area(s).</strong>
While the entire team will have and continually enhance core expertise in technology and organizational modernization, each team member will also further hone one or more Focus Areas that contribute to the collective, cross-functional capabilities within TTS’s Data &amp; Analytics Portfolio.</p>
