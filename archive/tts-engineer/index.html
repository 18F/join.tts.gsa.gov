<p>TTS is hiring for the role of GS-14-15 Engineer (IT Specialist). <strong>There are several TTS teams hiring for this role.</strong> Engineers are crucial to TTS significantly improving our products, platforms, and services. This is an opportunity to make a huge difference in the lives of the public and other federal agencies. This page contains a high-level summary of the role. <strong>When the position becomes live for applications, you will have the opportunity to select which role(s) you’re interested in applying for.</strong></p>

<h2 id="opportunity-overview">Opportunity overview</h2>

<p>These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS). TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.</p>

<h3 id="role-summary">Role summary</h3>
<p>TTS is looking for talented software developers who will help our partner agencies deliver better digital services to the public. As an engineer at TTS, you will be a builder, contributor, and catalyst. Working with folks across the organization, you will solve large, complex problems while promoting user-centered, open, and transparent culture. The role involves diverse responsibilities — you might be writing code one day, meeting with members from partner agencies another day, and launching a new product that will impact the lives of Americans across the country the next week. TTS values open source development, so most of what you will work on will be open source.</p>

<p>This role may be perfect for you if you have the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technical skills to tackle engineering problems</li>
  <li>Social skills to ask questions and work collaboratively with people from many disciplines</li>
  <li>Judgment to know when technology does or does not solve a problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Our ideal candidate will be equally excited about sticky technical issues and intricate human ones. Impact in this role can’t be measured on a GitHub contribution graph; ideal candidates should be equally comfortable writing code, explaining technical design architecture to both technical and less technical folks, and leading organizational strategy and change.</p>

<p>TTS’ core languages are Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. You should have strong, demonstrable experience with at least one of these languages and be proficient in web development, relational databases, and using Unix-like operating systems. You should understand engineering best practices such as source control, automated testing, continuous integration and deployment, and peer review. Experience in configuring or running in common cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud is very helpful. The strongest candidates will have a background working on cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams that deliver digital products and services in an incremental, user-focused environment.</p>

<h3 id="key-objectives">Key objectives</h3>
<p><strong>Key objective #1:</strong> You’ll contribute high-quality, well-tested, maintainable code across an entire project lifecycle, using best practices for modern software development.</p>

  <li>Influence project planning and design using usability research, analytics, and other metrics</li>

  <li>Take pride of ownership in all projects you touch; leave code better than you found it</li>
  <li>Contribute to documentation, tests, style fixes, accessibility, performance, security, and more</li>
  <li>Deliver code that’s easy to deploy, update, and monitor by ensuring that the necessary tooling is present early in the project development cycle or by introducing tooling into an existing project, as needed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key objective #2:</strong> You’ll positively contribute to the culture and knowledge of the engineering team, practicing and enthusiastically sharing agile methodologies throughout all stages of the project lifecycle.</p>
<ul>

  <li>Support a safe, inclusive workplace and a positive team culture where all team members value diversity and individual differences</li>
  <li>Provide visibility into each project’s progress, communicate blockers and challenges, and ask for help when you need it</li>
  <li>Demonstrate a strong understanding of the elements of agile methodology (scrum, kanban, etc)</li>
  <li>Practice human-centered design, user testing, feature prioritization, DevOps, test-driven development, and other relevant concepts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key objective #3:</strong> You’ll meet customer expectations, along with personal and organizational goals. You’ll produce high-quality results by applying technical knowledge, analyzing problems, and calculating risk.</p>

  <li>Make well-informed, effective, and timely decisions</li>
  <li>Identify and analyze problems in a constructive manner</li>
  <li>Explain technical issues and concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key objective #4:</strong> You’ll lead change, both within and outside the organization, to meet organizational goals. You’ll help establish an organizational vision and implement it in a continuously changing environment.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop new insights into situations and question conventional approaches</li>
  <li>Develop, implement, and drive technical strategy in engineering-specific and organization-wide contexts</li>
  <li>Keep up-to-date on policies and trends that affect the organization and shape stakeholders’ views</li>
  <li>Adapt to change and quickly integrate new information</li>
  <li>Formulate and execute consistently against objectives and priorities</li>
  <li>Take a long-term view and build a shared vision with people across TTS, GSA, and across the US Government</li>
</ul>
