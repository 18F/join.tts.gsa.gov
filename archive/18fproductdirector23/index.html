<h2 id="role-summary">Role summary</h2>

<p>18F is an office of federal employees within the General Services Administration (GSA) that collaborates with other agencies to fix technical problems, build products, and improve how government serves the public through technology. 18F is part of the Technology Transformation Services, which is within the Federal Acquisition Service.</p>

<p>18F envisions a country whose government consistently offers digital services that instill pride and trust, meet user needs, are secure, and are delivered quickly and at reasonable cost.</p>

<p>We develop partnerships with agencies to help them deliver exceptional digital experiences that address their strategic initiatives. Through our work together, we also aim to strengthen government technology practices in ways that last beyond our formal partnerships. We effect change by practicing user-centered development, testing to validate hypotheses, shipping often, and deploying products in the open.</p>

<p>The 18F Product Director leads the 18F chapter focused on driving products from concept to delivery. 18F product managers are strategic thinkers who are skilled in defining a compelling vision, designing a measurable strategy to achieve it, and enabling cross-functional teams to deliver on it. As Product Director, you’ll support employee development, foster inclusion, belonging, and growth within your team; lead hiring for 18F’s Product chapter; coach supervisors as they work with their direct reports; set a vision for the chapter; and represent the Product chapter as a member of 18F leadership.
