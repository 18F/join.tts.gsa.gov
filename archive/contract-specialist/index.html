<h2 id="role-summary">Role Summary:</h2>

<h3 id="contract-specialist---gs-13">Contract Specialist - GS-13</h3>

<p>Contracting Specialists — members of the TTS Office of Acquisition Team — possess two key qualities: excellent judgment and an unflinching belief that federal procurement can be joyful. Applicants for this position must either currently be employed in the 1102 Job Series or be qualified for <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/1100/contracting-series-1102/">placement in this job series</a> in compliance with OPM regulations.</p>

<p>Although a technology background isn’t a requirement for this position, it would be very helpful. Lightheartedness and empathy are desired for this role.</p>

<p>Contracting Specialists participate in three primary activities within TTS: assisting other agencies with digital-service-related procurements; conducting analyses and evaluations of other agencies’ existing acquisition “stacks” to help identify opportunities to improve results; and working on internal procurements and serving as warranted Contracting Officers (COs) for TTS purchases.</p>

<p>As a Contracting Specialist, you’ll work alongside a focused, cross-functional team of other digital service specialists — experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition, you’ll become part of the broader TTS network, which includes more than 200 digital specialists.</p>

<p>If you’ve read the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/">TechFAR</a> and believe that the government can buy digital services in a better way, this is the position for you.</p>
