# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #
# new file, and are not editing the template file! To create a new file, go to #
# https://github.com/18F/join.tts.gsa.gov/new/main/positions in your browser.  #
#                                                                              #
# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #
#                                                                              #
# NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job      #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #
# choose names like:                                                           #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #

#                                                                              #
# After the frontmatter, the rest of the document is in a special version of   #
# Markdown used by the website builder. You will see comments in that section  #
# as well, but they will look like this:                                       #
#                                                                              #
#    {% comment ----------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#    The contents in between these two lines are comments and do not           #
#    contribute to the web page.                                               #

# It is safe to remove the Markdown comments as well.                          #

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $143,736
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $191,900

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$143,736" max="$191,900" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
{% endcomment --------------------------------------------------------------- %}
{% include job/salary_range.html min="" max="" %}

Your salary, including base and locality, will be determined upon selection,
