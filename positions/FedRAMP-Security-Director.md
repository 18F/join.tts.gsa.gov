# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #
# new file, and are not editing the template file! To create a new file, go to #
# https://github.com/18F/join.tts.gsa.gov/new/main/positions in your browser.  #
#                                                                              #
# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #
#                                                                              #
# NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job      #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #

#                                                                              #
# After the frontmatter, the rest of the document is in a special version of   #
# Markdown used by the website builder. You will see comments in that section  #
# as well, but they will look like this:                                       #
#                                                                              #
#    {% comment ----------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#    The contents in between these two lines are comments and do not           #
#    contribute to the web page.                                               #

    - Grow FedRAMP’s ability to conduct, internally and through external partners, expert security reviews and “red team” style assessments of novel technical implementations and other security-critical components.
  - You will represent FedRAMP’s security vision, and build FedRAMP’s reputation and expertise.
    - Build FedRAMP’s overall technical capacity and information security expertise, through recruitment, training, and ongoing staff development.
    - Publicly represent FedRAMP and its security strategy to the public and to other external audiences.

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $172,075
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $183,500

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$172,075" max="$183,500" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

## Role summary

{% comment %}🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻{% endcomment %}
The Security Director leads FedRAMP’s information security program, establishing FedRAMP’s overall security priorities and vision. The role oversees the development and implementation of FedRAMP information security policies, creating a consistent, defensible and security-first approach across FedRAMP’s authorization process and its ongoing oversight over authorized cloud services. The Security Director, through their own work and their management of a team of federal employees and contractors, is responsible for maintaining and growing the trust placed in the FedRAMP marketplace.  

The position serves as one of the primary leaders working with the White House, FedRAMP’s board, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to position the program as a leader in cloud security.

FedRAMP was created in 2011 to accelerate the government’s use of commercial cloud services, by creating a standardized process for security review and authorization and making security information easily available to agencies. More generally, FedRAMP operates as a bridge between the public and private sectors, to help companies that offer innovative services to ensure these services meet core federal security expectations and to bring the best of the private sector into government. 

Since its creation, the cloud sector has changed substantially and agency needs have focused more on software-as-a-service products. In recent years, Congress and the White House have updated the program’s mission and authorities, with a mandate to scale and modernize the program, while continuing to ensure the high bar of security that the public expects around government data and operations.

To meet these goals, the Security Director will work across the government to strengthen federal cybersecurity policies and team up with federal partners on strategic initiatives that help agencies and cloud providers to stay focused on defending against contemporary threats. 

The position is a dynamic role that will drive FedRAMP’s overall approach to security and risk management, and will represent FedRAMP in government-wide security policy and priority deliberations. The role will require senior expertise in information security and related technology concepts, a strong ability to communicate and collaborate with different agencies and stakeholder groups, and strategic leadership to position the program as a cybersecurity leader and maintain trust in the FedRAMP brand.
