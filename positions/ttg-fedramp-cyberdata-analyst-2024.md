# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #
# new file, and are not editing the template file! To create a new file, go to #
# https://github.com/18F/join.tts.gsa.gov/new/main/positions in your browser.  #
#                                                                              #
# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #

# NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job      #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #

# After the frontmatter, the rest of the document is in a special version of   #
# Markdown used by the website builder. You will see comments in that section  #
# as well, but they will look like this:                                       #
#                                                                              #
#    {% comment ----------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#    The contents in between these two lines are comments and do not           #
#    contribute to the web page.                                               #

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $172,075
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $183,500

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$172,075" max="$183,500" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

## Role summary

{% comment %}🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻{% endcomment %}
FedRAMP’s Cyber Data Analyst will play a key role in building the data- and API-driven 
FedRAMP of the future. FedRAMP needs to take a proactive, data-centric approach to 
ensure that cloud-based software, platforms, and infrastructure are safe and easy 
for Federal agencies to use.

FedRAMP was created in 2011 to accelerate the government’s use of commercial 
cloud services, by creating a standardized process for security review and 
authorization, and making security information easily available to agencies. 
More generally, FedRAMP operates as a bridge between the public and private 
sectors, to help companies that offer innovative services navigate federal 
security expectations to bring the best of the private sector into government.

Cloud offerings have changed substantially and agency needs have focused more 
on software-as-a-service products. In recent years, Congress and the White House 
have updated the program’s mission and authorities, with a mandate to scale and 
modernize the program, while continuing to ensure the high bar of security that 
the public expects around government data and operations. One of FedRAMP’s key 
shifts is **moving to digital authorization packages, centralized monitoring, and 
the automation of security assessments and reviews, which require a data-centric 
approach.** 

This position will serve as a senior member of the FedRAMP Program Management 
Office (PMO) working on our strategic modernization and automation goals. The 
program is focused on operating as a data-centric program to support scaling 
its processes and ensuring a trusted marketplace of cloud services. 

As the Cyber Data Analyst, you will work and build partnerships with senior 
cybersecurity and technical staff within the program as well as leading cloud 
service providers, third party assessment organizations (3PAOs), tool vendors, 
and agencies. You will help FedRAMP design, develop, and implement automated data 
driven approaches for testing control implementations and continuous monitoring of 
cloud services. 

This position is a strategic, collaborative, outward-facing role that will require 
a blend of cybersecurity and data expertise, a focus on consistency and quality, 
and a future-focused view for how FedRAMP can use data in service of its mission.

## Key objectives

{% comment ------------------------------------------------------------------ %}
Key objectives are automatically converted from the information provided at the
top of the page. The automatic conversion helps ensure that all of our postings
are consistent. If you do not want to use the automatic template, delete the
line below that says {% include job/key_objectives.html %} and add your custom
content in its place.
{% endcomment --------------------------------------------------------------- %}

  - **Objective #1: You will increase program effectiveness through automation and technology-forward operations.**
    - Identify present and future cybersecurity data needs, and shift FedRAMP to become a data-centric program.
    - Drive the implementation and integration of appropriate technology, architecture, and tooling, including AI/ML capabilities, to support FedRAMP’s data and analytical needs and to scale its processes.
    - Design new program processes and systems  that take advantage of and enhance FedRAMP’s ability to understand threats and drive decisions through data. 
    - Shape FedRAMP’s policies, user guides, and overall strategic approach to FedRAMP’s technology and program roadmap.
      
  - **Objective #2: You will develop models to interpret cybersecurity data and inform cybersecurity risk.** 
    - Develop models that can identify quality or consistency issues in FedRAMP’s cybersecurity data and provide near-real-time feedback to cloud service providers, 3PAOs, and technology vendors.
    - Develop models that can identify anomalies, trends or patterns in the implementation or failure of  security controls, and better predict real-world  cybersecurity risk.
    - Design and build recommender systems, or other capabilities that can identify the controls or data that most need human review. 
    - Develop novel approaches to identify cybersecurity outliers and trends in large volumes of vulnerability data and other information continuously received from authorized cloud providers.
      
  - **Objective #3: You will maintain strong working relationships within the government, and with outside industry stakeholders and technical experts.**
    - Partner with cloud service providers (CSPs), third party assessment organizations (3PAOs), cybersecurity and risk management product vendors, and federal agencies on the development and implementation of data-driven cyber security approaches. 
    - Work closely with internal stakeholders, including the FedRAMP technical advisory group (TAG), to develop FedRAMP’s modernization strategy, and to build a foundation of data within the organization that is useful and supports those strategic objectives.
    - Partner with internal and external stakeholders to pilot new technologies and processes that validate the effectiveness of an automation- and data-based approach to cybersecurity.
