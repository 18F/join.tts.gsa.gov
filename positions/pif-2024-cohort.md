# INSTRUCTIONS: PIF/USDC/ETC JOB TEMPLATE                                      #
#                                                                              #

# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #
# new file, and are not editing the template file! To create a new file, go to #
# https://github.com/18F/join.tts.gsa.gov/new/main/positions in your browser.  #
#                                                                              #
# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #
#                                                                              #
# NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job      #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #
# choose names like:                                                           #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #

#                                                                              #
# It is safe to remove the Markdown comments as well.                          #

# This is the position title and the org that is doing the hiring. Please format
# your title as "Org: Position Title" (in quotes!). The organization should be
# a full name rather than an acronym. For example:
#   - U.S. Digital Corps, not USDC
#   - Presidential Innovation Fellows, not PIF
# The exception to this is a TTS role, for which you can just say TTS. 
#
# NOTE: Be sure to leave the "title: " part at the beginning! These line
# headings are how the site builder knows what the data is. For the rest of the
# frontmatter, please be careful not to delete the headings!

# Put the opening and closing dates of your posting here, if you have them. The
# values you set here will be turned into user-friendly text in other parts of
# this post. Setting it here means you won't have to copy it over and over.
#
# These dates MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where month and day are 2-digits.
# If the month number or day of the month are less than 10, add a 0 to the
# front (eg, May would be 05 instead of just 5). This is the only format the
# site builder automatically understands. Anything else will not be understood
# as a date.

opens: 2023-05-15
closes: 2023-07-07
# These dates are also used to determine whether a position is upcoming, open,
# or closed. Here's how we decide:
#
# The job is upcoming if:
#   opens is empty OR
#   opens is in the future
#
# The job is open if:
#   opens is in the past OR
#   closes is in the future
#
# The job is closed if:
#   closes is in the past
#
# If either opens or closes is empty, missing, or not a date, the position is
# considered to be upcoming.

# If there are any info sessions associated with this position, list them here.
# Each info session needs three pieces of information: the link, the date, and
# the time. See the placeholder below for an example of how to add an info
# session. If the position does not have any info sessions, you can just delete
# the lines that begin with spaces.
#
# IMPORTANT: The date MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where the month and day
# are TWO digits. If the month or day is less than 10, add a zero to the front.
# The date is used to sort the info sessions on the page so they are shown
# nearest to furthest. Only info sessions schedule for the future will be shown.
