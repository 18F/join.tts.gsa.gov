#
# These dates MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where month and day are 2-digits.
# If the month number or day of the month are less than 10, add a 0 to the

opens: 2023-04-03
closes: 2023-04-13
# These dates are also used to determine whether a position is upcoming, open,
# or closed. Here's how we decide:
#
# The job is upcoming if:
#   opens is empty OR
#   opens is in the future
#
# The job is open if:
#   opens is in the past OR
#   closes is in the future
#
# The job is closed if:
#   closes is in the past
#
# If either opens or closes is empty, missing, or not a date, the position is
# considered to be upcoming.

# If the position can also close when the maximum number of applications are
# received, include the maximum number of applications here. Remove this line
# or set the value to 0 if the job does not have an application cap.

# Is this a permanent or term appointment? Use either "perm" or "term". This

# The information you put here will be used to automatically pull salary range
# information.
#
# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: The automatic salary ranges are based on 100% remote
# positions and use the lowest and highest locality areas. If this position is
# not 100% remote, you will need to delete the automatic salary range and input
# it yourself down below. Look for 💰💰💰 to indicate where to do that.
#
# The salary range data is stored in this file:
#
#   _data/pay_ranges.yml
#
# The data file will need to be updated each year to reflect any pay changes.

# List key objectives here. Key objectives and sub-bullets will be displayed in
# the order they are listed here. You do not need to include key objective
# numbers. They will be added automatically.
#
# Each key objective starts on a new line and must start with a dash. It does
# not need to include a number at the beginning. A key objective can be spread
# across multiple lines if you want.
#
# To add sub-bullets to your key objective, add a new line below the key
# objective and indent it with spaces. (The number of spaces does not matter, as
# long as it is more than one). Then, add a dash and your sub-bullet.
# Sub-bullets can also take up multiple lines as long as all of the lines are
# indented the same amount so they line up.
#
# The placeholder information below shows an example of how to format the key
# objectives. This example indents sub-bullets with two spaces:
#🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
key objectives:
  - Leads the Login.gov delivery organization, providing direct oversight to the Login.gov branch chiefs for engineering, product management and user experience.
  - Directs, coordinates, or oversees work: supervisors or comparable personnel; and/or providing similar oversight of contractors.
  - Serves as the chief product advisor to the Login Director on all activities pertaining to Login.gov including the development of product objectives, long-range plans and organizational operating methods / processes necessary to accomplish program objectives.

  - Leads and supervises a team of Login.gov Branch Chiefs; provides mentorship, support and professional development opportunities. Acts for the Login.gov Division Director in their absence, with the full responsibility for the work of that position.

# If there are any info sessions associated with this position, list them here.
# Each info session needs three pieces of information: the link, the date, and
# the time. See the placeholder below for an example of how to add an info
# session. If the position does not have any info sessions, you can just delete
# the lines that begin with spaces.
#
# IMPORTANT: The date MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where the month and day
# are TWO digits. If the month or day is less than 10, add a zero to the front.
# The date is used to sort the info sessions on the page so they are shown
# nearest to furthest. Only info sessions schedule for the future will be shown.

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $172,075
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $183,500

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$172,075" max="$183,500" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
{% endcomment --------------------------------------------------------------- %}
{% include job/salary_range.html min="" max="" %}

Your salary, including base and locality, will be determined upon selection,
dependent on your actual duty location. Please note the maximum salary available
