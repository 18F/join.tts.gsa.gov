# INSTRUCTIONS: TTS JOB TEMPLATE                                               #
#                                                                              #

# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #
# new file, and are not editing the template file! To create a new file, go to #
# https://github.com/18F/join.tts.gsa.gov/new/main/positions in your browser.  #
#                                                                              #
# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #
#                                                                              #
# NOTE ABOUT FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job      #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #
# choose names like:                                                           #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #
#🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻                                                                   #
#                                                                              #
# After the frontmatter, the rest of the document is in a special version of   #
# Markdown used by the website builder. You will see comments in that section  #
# as well, but they will look like this:                                       #
#                                                                              #
#    {% comment ----------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#    The contents in between these two lines are comments and do not           #
#    contribute to the web page.                                               #
#    {% endcomment -------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#                                                                              #
# It is safe to remove the Markdown comments as well.                          #
#                                                                              #

# This is the position title and the org that is doing the hiring. Please format
# your title as "Org: Position Title" (in quotes!). The organization should be
# a full name rather than an acronym. For example:
#   - U.S. Digital Corps, not USDC
#   - Presidential Innovation Fellows, not PIF
# The exception to this is a TTS role, for which you can just say TTS. 
#
# NOTE: Be sure to leave the "title: " part at the beginning! These line

# Put the opening and closing dates of your posting here, if you have them. The
# values you set here will be turned into user-friendly text in other parts of
# this post. Setting it here means you won't have to copy it over and over.
#
# These dates MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where month and day are 2-digits.
# If the month number or day of the month are less than 10, add a 0 to the
# front (eg, May would be 05 instead of just 5). This is the only format the
# site builder automatically understands. Anything else will not be understood
# as a date.
#🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
opens: 2023-10-24
closes: 2023-10-30
# These dates are also used to determine whether a position is upcoming, open,
# or closed. Here's how we decide:
#
# The job is upcoming if:
#   opens is empty OR
#   opens is in the future
#
# The job is open if:
#   opens is in the past OR
#   closes is in the future
#
# The job is closed if:
#   closes is in the past
#
# If either opens or closes is empty, missing, or not a date, the position is
# considered to be upcoming.

# If the position can also close when the maximum number of applications are
# received, include the maximum number of applications here. Remove this line
# or set the value to 0 if the job does not have an application cap.

# The information you put here will be used to automatically pull salary range
# information.
#
# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: The automatic salary ranges are based on 100% remote
# positions and use the lowest and highest locality areas. If this position is
# not 100% remote, you will need to delete the automatic salary range and input
# it yourself down below. Look for 💰💰💰 to indicate where to do that.
#
# The salary range data is stored in this file:
#
#   _data/pay_ranges.yml
#
# The data file will need to be updated each year to reflect any pay changes.

# List key objectives here. Key objectives and sub-bullets will be displayed in
# the order they are listed here. You do not need to include key objective
# numbers. They will be added automatically.
#
# Each key objective starts on a new line and must start with a dash. It does
# not need to include a number at the beginning. A key objective can be spread
# across multiple lines if you want.
#
# To add sub-bullets to your key objective, add a new line below the key
# objective and indent it with spaces. (The number of spaces does not matter, as
# long as it is more than one). Then, add a dash and your sub-bullet.
# Sub-bullets can also take up multiple lines as long as all of the lines are
# indented the same amount so they line up.
#
# The placeholder information below shows an example of how to format the key
# objectives. This example indents sub-bullets with two spaces:
