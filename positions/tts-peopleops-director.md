## Opportunity Overview

This opportunity is located within Technology Transformation Services (TTS)
which is a part of Federal Acquisition Services (FAS) in the General Services

improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their
services more accessible, efficient, and effective with innovative products,
platforms, and services.sd

## Role Summary

The People Operations team at TTS owns the relationship and experience with
staff and supervisors for all things talent (other than hiring) starting when
an employee comes on-board through an employee off-boarding. They are experts
in people related policy, regulations and bureaucratic requirements. They
create and maintain the infrastructure and support that’s needed to meet the
requirements of hiring and working within the federal government. Moreover, they

the mundane details of working (compensation, benefits, moving, etc.) and make
sure they have everything they need to do great work.

As the People Operations Director, you will oversee areas of Business Operations
