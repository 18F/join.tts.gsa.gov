# If you are editing this file on GitHub, first make sure you are creating a   #

# On the new file page, you can paste in the contents of the template file.    #
# Also be sure to type in a filename in the small textbox above the file body  #
# box. You will see the text join.tts.gsa.gov / [ Name your file ...] in main. #
# Type your filename into that box.                                            #

# NOTE ABOUTE FILENAMES: Your filename should be descriptive about the job     #
# posting that you're creating, and it MUST end with ".md". Don't stress out   #
# about filenames too much, though. They are used for the URL, which can help  #
# people make sure they're on the right page, but most users will probably not #
# notice the URL. Instead, try to make it meaningful to you and others on the  #
# Talent Team so you can find it easily in the future if you need to edit it.  #
#                                                                              #
# For example, if you are posting a job for a content designer, you might      #

# For the rest of the file, follow the directions as you go, but here are a    #
# couple more tips to help you as you work:                                    #
#                                                                              #
# You are currently inside the portion of the document called "frontmatter."   #
# The frontmatter is the part that starts with just "---" on the first line    #
# and ends with another line that only contains "---" (further down). This     #
# part of the document is not DIRECTLY shown to the user. Instead, this is     #
# where you can set data that will be shown to the user in other parts of the  #
# page, or data that is used to configure how the page is displayed. For       #
# example, the opens and closes dates are set in the frontmatter, but they     #
# will never be shown to the user the way you type them in. Instead, they are  #
# used to determine whether the posting is upcoming, open, or closed, and they #
# will be turned into more human-friendly text when they are displayed.        #
#                                                                              #
# Within this frontmatter block, lines that begin with a hash (#) symbol are   #
# comments. They do not contribute to the web page at all, but they are a nice #
# way of explaining what the data in the frontmatter is. It is okay to delete  #
# these comments when you are done, and it is also okay to leave them if they  #
# might be helpful when editing the page later.                                #
#                                                                              #
# The parts you need to fill out are marked with five red triangles above them #
# like this:                                                                   #

# After the frontmatter, the rest of the document is in a special version of   #
# Markdown used by the website builder. You will see comments in that section  #
# as well, but they will look like this:                                       #
#                                                                              #
#    {% comment ----------------------------------------------------------- %} #
#    The contents in between these two lines are comments and do not           #
#    contribute to the web page.                                               #

# If the month number or day of the month are less than 10, add a 0 to the

#   closes is in the future

#
# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: The automatic salary ranges are based on 100% remote
# positions and use the lowest and highest locality areas. If this position is
# not 100% remote, you will need to delete the automatic salary range and input
# it yourself down below. Look for 💰💰💰 to indicate where to do that.
#
# The salary range data is stored in this file:

# The data file will need to be updated each year to reflect any pay changes.

# List key objectives here. Key objectives and sub-bullets will be displayed in
# the order they are listed here. You do not need to include key objective
# numbers. They will be added automatically.
#
# Each key objective starts on a new line and must start with a dash. It does
# not need to include a number at the beginning. A key objective can be spread
# across multiple lines if you want.
#
# To add sub-bullets to your key objective, add a new line below the key
# objective and indent it with spaces. (The number of spaces does not matter, as
# long as it is more than one). Then, add a dash and your sub-bullet.
# Sub-bullets can also take up multiple lines as long as all of the lines are
# indented the same amount so they line up.

# session. If the position does not have any info sessions, you can just delete
# the lines that begin with spaces.
#
# IMPORTANT: The date MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where the month and day
# are TWO digits. If the month or day is less than 10, add a zero to the front.
# The date is used to sort the info sessions on the page so they are shown
# nearest to furthest. Only info sessions schedule for the future will be shown.

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $172,075
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $183,500

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$172,075" max="$183,500" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
{% endcomment --------------------------------------------------------------- %}
{% include job/salary_range.html min="" max="" %}

Your salary, including base and locality, will be determined upon selection,
dependent on your actual duty location. Please note the maximum salary available
for the GS pay system is $183,500. For specific details on locality pay, please
