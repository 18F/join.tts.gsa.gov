# Put the opening and closing dates of your posting here, if you have them. The
# values you set here will be turned into user-friendly text in other parts of
# this post. Setting it here means you won't have to copy it over and over.
#
# These dates MUST be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, where month and day are 2-digits.
# If the month number or day of the month are less than 10, add a 0 to the
# front (eg, May would be 05 instead of just 5). This is the only format the

opens: 2023-04-03
closes: 2023-04-10
# These dates are also used to determine whether a position is upcoming, open,
# or closed. Here's how we decide:
#
# The job is upcoming if:
#   opens is empty OR
#   opens is in the future
#
# The job is open if:
#   opens is in the past OR
#   closes is in the future
#
# The job is closed if:
#   closes is in the past
#
# If either opens or closes is empty, missing, or not a date, the position is
# considered to be upcoming.

# If the position can also close when the maximum number of applications are
# received, include the maximum number of applications here. Remove this line
# or set the value to 0 if the job does not have an application cap.

# Is this a permanent or term appointment? Use either "perm" or "term". This

# The information you put here will be used to automatically pull salary range
# information.
#
# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE: The automatic salary ranges are based on 100% remote
# positions and use the lowest and highest locality areas. If this position is
# not 100% remote, you will need to delete the automatic salary range and input
# it yourself down below. Look for 💰💰💰 to indicate where to do that.
#
# The salary range data is stored in this file:
#
#   _data/pay_ranges.yml
#
# The data file will need to be updated each year to reflect any pay changes.

# List key objectives here. Key objectives and sub-bullets will be displayed in
# the order they are listed here. You do not need to include key objective
# numbers. They will be added automatically.
#
# Each key objective starts on a new line and must start with a dash. It does
# not need to include a number at the beginning. A key objective can be spread
# across multiple lines if you want.
#
# To add sub-bullets to your key objective, add a new line below the key
# objective and indent it with spaces. (The number of spaces does not matter, as
# long as it is more than one). Then, add a dash and your sub-bullet.
# Sub-bullets can also take up multiple lines as long as all of the lines are
# indented the same amount so they line up.
#
# The placeholder information below shows an example of how to format the key
# objectives. This example indents sub-bullets with two spaces:

The salary range for the job can be populated automatically based on the GS
grade this posting is advertised at, based on the lowest and highest locality
rates.

💰💰💰
If this position is not remote and has geographic restrictions, you can instead
specify the salary min and max. For example, if the position is advertised at
GS-15 and the position location is only Washington, DC, then (using 2023 pay
rates):

Minimum:
  GS-15 Step 1: $172,075
Maximum:
  GS-15 Step 10: $183,500

So you would update the line below to look like this:

    {% include job/salary_range.html min="$172,075" max="$183,500" %}

To use the autoomatic salary ranges, leave the lines as-is.

🔻🔻🔻🔻🔻
{% endcomment --------------------------------------------------------------- %}
{% include job/salary_range.html min="" max="" %}

Your salary, including base and locality, will be determined upon selection,
dependent on your actual duty location. Please note the maximum salary available
